mapmaking endeavor, the subtitle of this book, </a><i>Applied Mapping</i>, is as necessarily deceptive as its cartographic subject. recalling the work of Mark Monmonier, this ambitious project to make mapping useful to designers of the built environment finds virtue in the way maps lie by omission. For newman, this deception is productive in that it foregrounds matters of selection and judgment which should be at the heart of any design practice. Put another way, as the author suggests, a map that offers a perfect representation of its cultural or geographic territory would be functionally useless for the purposes of design, creative thought, and ultimately, world-making. As she writes, ‘the world is constantly revealing itself around us, but to see we must create a productive gap between lived experience and our representations, not as mirrors hide our biases, but as possible worlds we can knowingly choose to unfold.’ newman’s hypothesis here is an optimistic one, aimed at effecting the theoretical scaffolding through which design can assume greater agency in the production of alternative futures. The book is part manifesto and part historical survey, but resists being collapsed into either genre. It is an unapologetically operative document concerned as much with locating the structure that enables the formation of representational method as it is with the comparative intelligence and relative strength of the methods themselves. In short, it both is and performs like a map. By newman’s estimation, we are all cartographic beings and we operate as mapmakers regardless of whether or not we are conscious of the process. Mapmaking is like the scientific method; it is like the act of thought itself. These metaphors are crucial to newman’s project, yet they are capable of being more fully instrumentalized, or put to work. here, we see that the ‘applied’ of the book’s subtitle refers not to an abstract set of rules which designers can simply import to their work, but rather is a nod to the fact that maps are nothing if not applied; that there can be no analysis without interpretation, or for that matter, creation. Maps are never value-neutral or outside of the world of things which they work through and reshape. For newman, the intellectual project of unmasking the logic of maps as subjective, conscious projections into the world is but the first step toward coming to terms with the ways in which our mapmaking facility can be used to produce a multitude of possible</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">worlds, each ideally more beneficent than those we currently inhabit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">This utopian claim is by no means a modest objective, nor is it without certain dangers, and newman, steeped by training in the cautionary tales of Foucault and Baudrillard, seeks a balanced approach throughout her text that suspends the question of privileging fact or</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Foreword</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">fiction. And, though newman’s particular bias is to insist that we not lose sight of the ‘there, there,’ or the real purpose which underwrites our efforts, her methods do not preclude a journey into pure fantasy as a roundabout way to return to the factual world on radically different terms. It becomes up to the mapmaker and the designer to exercise judgment in that regard and to decide the most useful approach with respect to the situation. To take one example, she argues that harold Fisk’s 1944 map of the Mississippi river for the U.S. Army Corps of engineers is powerful less for its accuracy than for its suggestiveness in conveying the dynamics of a fluvial system. Somewhat paradoxically, as a function of its symbolic power, the fuzzy imprecision of one map is often valuable for the precision of the subsequent observations, projects, and spin-offs it inspires—the local revisions, the specific political or ecological challenges to its authority, or its wholesale replacement by a more convincing, interesting, or usable alternative.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The perpetual testing of alternatives in the space between this world and the next one we might imagine—‘somewhere between the real and the virtual, the probable and possible’—is, for newman, a fundamentally cartographic endeavor, and by extension, the very activity of life. This is the ethos of her pedagogical project as well and the book’s structure is indicative of the approach she takes in the studio and the seminar room. here, song lyrics, observant pop culture analysis and case studies drawn from the work of her students brush up against projects and insights gleaned from a litany of critical thinkers from both inside and surrounding the design disciplines. The book is an evocative hybrid offering readers a diverse array of points into and out of the text. Some fragments more directly appeal to design students, while others seek to supply design instructors with the frameworks and vocabularies through which to reconceive of their practices and modes of instruction.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Across it all however, newman displays a method of investigation that quite literally makes ‘use’ of its subjects as a way of turning use into the book’s primary subject. The spirit here, however, is less one of appropriation than conversation as sources appear as fellow interlocutors in a collective endeavor. At times channeling Colin rowe’s theorization of collage, newman’s project complements and revises that architectural point of departure. It updates the idea of collage in the twin sense of building upon and improving its capacity to relate to evolving social and material conditions that fall outside the purview of the figure- ground plan or the weight of place implied in the concept of <i>genius loci</i>. If the designer or architect is to remain, or perhaps even truly evolve into a <i>bricoleur</i>, he or she would need to develop the capacity to accommodate a staggering variety of historical precedents, cognitive inputs, conflicting data sets, and cues from environments both virtual and physical. For newman, the conscious study of the processes and techniques of mapping allows us to confidently approach this uncharted territory with the knowledge that somehow we’ve done this before and can do so again in more interesting and humane ways. newman’s hypothesis, and the major contribution of this book, is its suggestion that how we go about doing so is always twofold. It involves developing a new set of analytical tools capable of bringing our maps into agreement with our intentions and desires, while also recognizing that we should be open to the refashioning of the premises of those desires that may come through our methodical engagement with the practices of mapmaking.</p><p style="padding-left: 242pt;text-indent: 210pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Felipe Correa Associate Professor, harvard University graduate School of Design</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2">The goal of this book is to help designers working with built environments make better maps. Using maps instrumentally in the design process enables designers to calibrate their observations about site, place, idea and the parameters of a given project. Cartographers, geographers,  and  cultural  historians  acknowledge  existing  frameworks  for  creating  and understanding  relationships  through  the  map  began  to  change  in  the  mid-twentieth century.  likewise  in  the  disciplines  that  address  built  environments  terms  like  zoning, boundary condition, and master plan, typically represented through the map, no longer adequately  describe,  catalogue,  or  represent  what  are  now  understood  as  complex, culturally speciﬁc contexts, expectations about performance over time, and process and information networks. new forms of mapmaking and new tools for representation allow data-intensive maps to be assembled quickly and easily. When used as an applied research method in design, mapping reveals a complex of relationships between representation and thinking,  technology,  culture,  and  aesthetic  practices.  Preparing,  cataloguing,  weighting, and reducing data to capture a productive representation of a condition is an important tool. This book shares knowledge from multiple disciplines about cartographical thinking in order to map potential scenarios for a synthetic understanding of a broad range of quantitative, qualitative, and spatial data sets.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3"><h1 href="#bookmark0">Acknowledgments</h1></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I owe much to the works of Mark Monmonier and Alan Maceachren on cartography,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">J.

The  idea  for  this  project  emerged  in  response  to  a belief in the need for more robust mapping practices in the design disciplines. Maps are potentially a methodological system for organizing experiential phenomenon and ideation in a design process. Any errors or omissions in conveying these ideas are my own. It was challenging to balance how to convey guides for making maps and theories that structure map content, intent and use. The book draws from maps prepared by students for a series of courses taught at Washington University in St. louis, harvard University, the University of Tennessee and Florida International University. Special gratitude is extended to these students whose work added significantly to the quality and depth of the maps in the book. Their  contributions  to  the  ongoing  discussion  of  the  way  spatial  designers  use  maps were invaluable. especially helpful with archival material was the library of Congress, the Imperial War Museum, Fondazione MAXXI, lockheed Martin Corporation, MIT Press, the royal Institute of British Architecture, Alice Debord, Akio kawasumi, eisenman robertson Architects, and the gemeente Museum den haag. nicholas Wise, Sohee ryan and haley Walton assisted with image editing and nicholas’s and Sohee’s wonderful diagrams are seen  throughout.  Wendy  Fuller,  Trudy  Varcianna  and  John  hodgson  guided  me  and  the book  through  publishing  with  great  care.  Support  for  the  early  stages  of  the  book  was provided through a graham Foundation grant, Florida University International and harvard University. Special thanks are due to the University of Arkansas and the office of research and Special Projects. Their generous support made the final steps of the book possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">Introduction</a><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a></p><ol id="l1"><ol id="l2"><li><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark47" class="a">: John nasmyth and James Carpenter, </a><a href="#bookmark47" class="s22">The Moon Considered as a Planet, a World and a Satellite </a><a href="#bookmark47" class="a">(1885), from the book collections of the new York Public library [Public domain], Courtesy of the Internet </a><a href="#bookmark47">Archive</a></p></li><li><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark52" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark6">,  </a>0.3<a href="#bookmark52" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">,  </a>0.4<a href="#bookmark47" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">:  </a><a href="#bookmark47" class="a">B.

Mapping and mapmaking emerge as ubiquitous modes of thinking in the last twenty years—you don’t have to look far in any discipline to find a map. harder to find is a literature addressing how to use maps as tools in design. one problem is maps are familiar: the naturalness in the way we read them obscures their complexity as representations. Artist Stanley Brouwn invoked the familiarity of the map in a provocative project done over a two-day period in Amsterdam (1961). Brouwn randomly selected people on the street and asked them for directions. he offered them paper on which to draw their responses and sometimes they took him up on this, sometimes not—later he would stamp ‘This Way Brouwn’ on the sheet of paper. ‘As they were drawing, people talked,’ Brouwn explains,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark117" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark11">at times they talked more than they drew. on the sketches we can see what the people were explaining. But we cannot see what they have omitted, because they had trouble realizing what might be clear to them still requires explanation.</a><a href="#bookmark117" class="s26">2</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Using maps as communication tools masks their complexity as a mode of thinking. Maps act like language: we attribute the signs or marks in the map to a natural extension of thought. But post-structuralism exposed maps (like language) as artificial signs whose meaning is tethered to time, place, culture, gesture, smell—in short, a plethora of cognitive and phenomenal attributes of our communication ecology. Mikhail Bakhtin uses a lovely term for the primacy of context over text—<i>heteroglossia</i>. equal significance is given to the nature of the utterance and the way words are aware of and mutually reflect other words—words live in seas filled with the ebb and flow of all other words. As part of a communication ecology maps employ cartographical thinking in excess of mere representation. In a similar way to the passers-by in ‘This Way Brouwn’ whose marks and words created a seamless continuity to the degree</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">they could not ‘see’ the gap between what they said and what they drew. The book examines maps in the context of the cartographic imagination and its expression through the form of the map used: ichnographic, cognitive, or photogrammetric. The attention is on mapmaking as a strategy for calibrating the gap between observations about territory, idea, or object and their representation so designers develop informed hypothesis in design.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Mapmaking begins with an observation or set of observations. observations are made in a detached mode where you think about a subject—it becomes object—aware of the act of standing separate from the object of thought. When fashioned as maps, observations trace the mapmakers’ ‘thoughts about thinking’ and the object of thought. Consider the primal perception of the infant received as a singular object with many parts—infants don’t perceive themselves separate from the world around them. Their lived experience is an undifferentiated world. It is with maturation and social communication the demand for categories arises: red is a color, cows are animals, our earth is a round thing and so forth. But unlike infants we are caught in our own subjectivity. Maps isolate parts of reality from the whole of reality without fully disrupting originary relationships—allowing us to slip between whole/part, object/subject, point/field, or identity/non-identity on a continuum rather than closed sets or categories necessarily defined by contrasts. Instead of thinking of the map as an objective tool, I propose it more as a phenomenon of perception albeit one cloaking itself in positivist respectability.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark117" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark12">For my purposes the maps included in the book move outside of representations historically considered maps to architectural representations, spatial models of data surfaces, abstract analytical models, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artifacts like panoramas and dioramas, military camouflage, photographs and cinematic images, film and videos. histories of cartography privileging terrestrial or geospatial maps were until recently predominantly oriented towards the West and mostly promoted an underlying progressive determinism: map accuracy, correspondence and detail improves as our technologies of measurement make it possible.</a><span class="s27">3 </span>I don’t assume the same approach but look instead at spatial organizations implied by the construct in the map—like the spatial order of the itinerary mapped in the <i>Tabula Peutingeriana</i>, a thirteenth-century map of roman troop movements copied from a map dating to the fourth or fifth centuries, compared to recent itinerary maps by students. This book isn’t a history of cartography although it includes a number of historical maps. It is an epistemology of spatial thinking invoking the map as a representational modality for communicating geospatial thinking.<a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14">recent histories of cartography by J.

My goal is furthering mapping practices enabling designers to hypothesize new conditions, cognitive approaches, and perspectives. Multiple intersections occur between cartography, social history, psychology, philosophies of science and technology, and the engineering cultures of architecture including landscape, interior, and urban architecture. Unpacking the epistemic cultures of representation in mapmaking and reading foregrounds productive dialogue between these disciplines. The subject can’t be dealt with comprehensively in one book but I’m hoping to convey in part how geospatial thinking predicts the kinds of geographies we make and inhabit.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The structure of the book is itself a map. reading it means looking carefully at text and comparing maps. The maps bear careful examination revealing rich layers of information only on close examination. A number of maps are redrawn from the original to improve legibility or highlight specific qualities. The book outlines general principles governing how maps are made. When applied to specific problems these yield an infinite number of possible maps. The maps in the book cover varied cultures, places, and times from maps made by renaissance cartographers to maps by students in architecture, urban design, and landscape architecture. A note to the reader—my intention is not to offer instruction in software or graphics. A few of these resources are given as additional reading, but in the main a plethora of books addressing the mechanical construction of maps are readily available and provide an interested reader software instruction or domain-specific techniques for managing effective graphics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Visualizing</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark16">A brief explanation of the term visualization, especially regarding its relation to maps and mapping, before we proceed. In the broadest sense visualization is the power or process of forming a mental picture or vision of something not actually present to sight.

Maps include experiential, non-quantifiable, and qualitative information. Cognitive maps are one type exemplifying this notion. Say you make a map for a friend giving them directions to your home, you would probably use a combination of lines representing roads, arrows to show direction and significant landmarks—‘turn right when you see the big brick building’ or ‘take a left at the fast food place.’ on the face of it this looks like quanta—measurable information about how to move toward a goal (in this case, your house), but a second look will reveal this is your interpretation of this path—someone else may have noticed different landmarks or different signs. As your cognitive map, it is data generated from your subjective and personal experiences.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">orit halpern in <i>Beautiful Data </i>reminds us ‘vision’ is a term that ‘multiplies—visualizations, visuality, visibilities’ and these</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark17">permutations of the term ‘vision’ demonstrate vision can’t be simply the isolated sense of vision but must be, following Walter Benjamin, a </a><i>technical condition</i>—and, following Foucault, what makes the <i>organization of the senses </i><a href="#bookmark119" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">critical to understanding the tactics of governance and power at any historical moment (emphasis mine).</a><a href="#bookmark119" class="s26">8</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Visualization is defined as process and object, epistemology, subject and discipline—all terms equally applicable to maps and mapping.

Making a map is the physical production including conceptualization and design. Mapping is the mental interpretation of the world and although it must precede the map, it does not necessarily result in a map artifact.</a><span class="s27">9 </span>Mapping defined in mathematics is the <i>correspondence </i>between each element of a given set with each element of another. Similarly in linguistics emphasis is on the correspondence between associated elements of different types. For designers all drawings are maps—they represent relationships between objects, places and ideas. Cartographers Arthur robinson and Barbara Petchenik offer that, ‘A map is a graphic <i>representation </i><a href="#bookmark120" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">of the milieu.’</a><span class="s27">10 </span>The key word is ‘representation’ because it emphasizes map-representations are <i>separate from </i>the reality they describe. It seems obvious but mapping, as the mental interpretation of the world, and mapmaking are easily confused.

This assures an organization and basis for predictability, which are shared by absolutely everyone. This proposition appears to be so fundamental that apparently it is simply adopted a priori.</a><a href="#bookmark120" class="s26">11</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21"><span class="p">Although the idea of maps as intellectual space continues to resonate, the notion the same  cognitive or intellectual  frame is  shared by ‘absolutely  everyone’ doesn’t.

There was increasing use of thematic cartography allowing for the representation of abstracted and nonvisual phenomena and the post-structuralist ‘spatial turn’ implicating the relationship between ideas and the spatial context in which they are formulated and received.</a>17 <span class="p">This affected designers indirectly, but significantly. historically designers used maps to describe conditions of place: road maps, site maps of various types like pedestrian routes, building types, and locational or environmental conditions of place. Until the introduction of the figure/ground map by Colin rowe, maps used by designers tended to ideal representations of places. Figure/ground or </span><span class="s2">gestalt </span><a href="#bookmark122" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">maps show buildings as figures in white and context in black. Used to represent urban plans this map type created a visual contrast between building and ground underscoring the continuity of the spaces between buildings. The gestalt map contested the building as object instead creating continuity between building and space. In the 1980s Peter eisenman, using French theorist Jacques Derrida, explored the mapping procedure to manage buildings as narrative. The process resulted in site maps with a variety of imposed grids articulating different narratives according to survey information, historical conditions, and other types of data. Buildings were extruded from the palimpsest created by these superimpositions. For eisenman the plan-map acts as commentary or exegesis on the geographical location through the map-texts referencing the history of the site. These examples suffice as an introduction to mapping and maps. They demonstrate the relatively new mode of hypothesis-making using maps, however if the number of recent books on maps, graphics for maps and software used to produce them is any indication, maps are quickly becoming a significant representational technology in the design arsenal. Cartographic ideation, or what Derek gregory called the ‘geographical imagination,’ changes with the technologies used to produce maps, but many of the inherent structures of visual analogues for the world persists throughout the history of maps.</a>18 <span class="p">The geographical imagination links the social and technological to the ‘world-as-exhibition’ where our representations of the world act in the place of unmediated seeing. gregory proposes practices like mapping are part of a larger epistemology of representation influencing how we see the world through the lens of national boundaries, perspectival grids, the division of lands into parcels, practices of camouflage and surveillance and place names.

Mapping  produces  spatial  practices  as  it  inscribes geographical places or conceptual ideation. limiting how we use maps in effect limits our capacity to think about places and ideas through the map. Franco Farinelli proposes our capacity for rationality itself may be determined from a cartographical point of view: the grapheme lies at the heart of our capacity for reasoned thought. In effect we possess a cartographical reason enabling us to project ourselves into geographical space.</a><a href="#bookmark122" class="s26">2</a><span class="s27">1  </span>James Corner proposed maps are ‘unfolding potential.’ The function of maps is not to depict but  to  enable;  ‘mappings  do  not  <i>represent  </i>geographies  of  ideas;  rather  they  <i>effect actualization’ </i><a href="#bookmark123" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(original emphasis).

Another way to consider the problem is using an example from language. This isn’t outside the pale. Chorley and haggett remind us that, ‘It is characteristic that maps should be likened to languages and scientific theories … we sometimes think of maps as models for languages and scientific theories.’</a><a href="#bookmark124" class="s26">2</a><span class="s27">3  </span><a href="#bookmark124" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">however, language severs the object/ word  relationship  in  a  particular  way  bearing  examination.  Maps  and  language  share many structural attributes but the distinctions are significant: words stand in for objects so we bring to mind their referents. once the link between word and object is created the sign itself is effectively severed from the object. To paraphrase kenneth Burke, ‘What is the representation of what?’</a><a href="#bookmark124" class="s26">2</a><span class="s27">4  </span>An illustration of the problem from Burke’s ‘dramatism’ proposes we treat language as a kind of action mediating between the social realm and the  realm  of  nonverbal  nature—an  elaboration  on  Spinoza’s  insistence  things  must  be understood in their overall context instead of treating words as ontologically real entities. Burke  offers  a  linguistic  model  where  things  are  the  signs  of  words.  Thus  he  gives  an example  sentence,  ‘The  man  walks  down  the  street.’  What  man?  Is  he  tall,  short,  fat, blond?  Is  this  a  walking-situation,  a  street-situation,  a  man-situation?  The  sentence  as stated  <i>cannot  </i>be  illustrated.  language  falls  short  of  the  spatial  problem  where  maps may fall short of language’s capacity for brevity—‘the man walks down the street’ takes significant time to map, but little effort to say. Just as language delineates the temporal ordering of our intellectual or cognitive process, the spatial ordering of the map confirms our assumptions about relative locations of objects and ideas in context and informs the structure of the context.<a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Questioning the structure of the context opens up a way to recapitulate the ontology of the map. If maps aren’t mirrors of nature but as Pickles argues, ‘producers of nature,’ their status as representations is itself in question. For Pickles, maps and cartography don’t simply explain the world—they are part of the ‘interplay between the world and ourselves’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark125" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark34">describing the world exposed to us through our questions. rob kitchin and Martin Dodge pushed the theory of maps to the limits of the ontology where maps aren’t treated as unified representations but constellations of ongoing processes.</a>25 <span class="p">These are the social, political, scientific and technological worlds in which maps are made and received.

Without  contradicting  the  notion  maps  register  give  and  take  between culture and perception, the ‘interplay between the world and ourselves’, what matters is the specific nature of the representational model of creating and receiving what is mapped— what registers on the visual schema of the map. First, we need to interrogate the ontological status of images and representations.

The man in the street would most likely not make a great distinction between image and representation—on the surface, images, like representations, share the notion of artificial imitation or the re-presentation of something, but where image offers a sense of the idea of <i>imitation </i>(lat. <i>imitatio</i>) or copy, <i>representation </i><a href="#bookmark125" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">is more about denoting symbolically, as in a symbol or sign, or the action of portraying a person or a thing.</a><a href="#bookmark125" class="s26">2</a><span class="s27">8  </span>The difference is instructive for maps.

With little work, manipulation or distortions created in taking or processing photographs produces clearly not-real photographs, like panoramic views physically impossible for us to experience. These exceptions prove the rule: photographs are representations or simulations of what we ‘see’ with rules of construction depending on the contexts discussed: what lens is used, who takes the photograph, the way it is displayed, received and catalogued.</a>32 <span class="p">Photographs when used as maps often have captions and are positioned in relation to other images and text.

The receptive mode is rational and distant. Chorographic maps, in contrast, convey a limited knowledge of the topography of the earth but convey cultural context focusing on individual parts, the qualities not quantities associated with a condition.</a>34 <a href="#bookmark126" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">geographic maps require some cartographic knowledge on the part of the viewer where chorographic maps are pictorial and present features of a place to the viewer in perspectival views more like tourist maps. Studying tourism in Bangkok, Thailand, Stephen hanna and Vincent Del Casino turn specifically to tourist maps to understand this mode of reception.</a>35 <span class="p">They argue visitors must use tourist maps in the context of other texts, narratives like guided tours, and conversations with strangers to ‘read’ back into the map; rendering it legible as more than color, lines and graphics. The tourist is both consumer and producer of space where ‘maps, spaces and identities as interrelated </span><span class="s2">processes </span><a href="#bookmark126" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">rather than final products.’ Using identity and post-structuralist theories from Deleuze, guattari and Judith Butler they show maps are ‘intertextual,’ meant to be used in the presence of a broad range of existing representations of the place being mapped, social histories, and personal perceptions: a ‘map space.’</a>36 <a href="#bookmark127" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Map space is the unbounded, changing space of the map produced by social actors using the map. Del Casino and hanna remind us these spaces must remain ambiguous because any attempt to ‘fix oppositional categories, boundaries and other meanings is always partial.’ Ambiguity is what makes map space so potent for a designer. Map space becomes the interactive mode of production and reception for the representation of spatial relations, ideas, or things in the design process.</a><a href="#bookmark127" class="s26">37</a><a name="bookmark44">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark45">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark46">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagram, Image, or Map?</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The conventions of mapping also apply to other kinds of data.

The map hypothesizes ridges produced with aging (like those shown on the apple and the human hand) are akin to the ridges and craters seen on the moon produced by the activity of a heated core through volcanism (a popular belief at the time). Although incorrect, the power of the <i>representation of aging </i>coupled with argumentation in naysmith and Carpenter’s theory was popular with planetary scientists for over 70 years until we landed on the moon and disproved their hypothesis.

Visual representations of data engage our cognitive perceptions, graphic skills, and rational capacity to synthesize complex ideas. For designers, maps represent observations about places, ideas or relationships. Being able to frame, represent, and order data through maps empowers the process of thinking, including thinking visually. In the twenty-first century, synthesis of complex data is a hallmark of critical thinking in all areas of knowledge. organizing information means creating links between chains of data, links between quantitative and qualitative data, and links between ideas through data. Visually organizing data means managing these links at the intersection of visual perception, representation, and the imagination. See for example B. W. Betts’ representations of human psychology through geometrically abstracted figures resembling flowers (</a>Figures 0.2<a href="#bookmark52" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, </a>0.3<a href="#bookmark52" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, and </a>0.4<span style=" color: #231F20;">).

They are similar in kind but not degree. Diagrams share some of the structure but don’t quantify or qualify spatio-temporal relationships in the same way as maps. They are ‘simpliﬁed ﬁgures to convey essential meaning,’ whereas maps tend toward robust meaning relative to the subject.</a><span class="s27">45 </span><a href="#bookmark129" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Symbols in diagrams have multiple possible significations until we specify or point to their meaning through context using an index. Diagrams are indexical, i.e. they point to something, but they aren’t indexed: they don’t order or organize within a larger context nor do they have a spatio-temporal dimension like maps. Diagram 0.1 illustrates the point: at first glance it seems communicative. The sequence suggests a set of operations performed on a simple box. Arrows indicate possible forces, movement, or points at which deformations in the ‘box’ take place. But without a specific context and an index or more structure, meaning is inferred but not secure. First, the box-shape is scale-less. It could be a building, a piece of gum, a special type of material, even a section of a larger entity as yet determined. Second, the arrows could mean a number of possible ideas: people-movement, direction of deformation, direction of wind, water, how a participant is supposed to move the game piece (if indeed this is a game) or any other number of possible combinations. The point is the diagram in itself doesn’t contain enough structure to communicate phenomenal information enabling it as a simulacrum. Designers often confuse diagrams as maps. The danger is diagrams don’t offer much in the way of phenomenal information and aren’t meaningful for hypothesis making for spatio-temporal conditions. Diagrams are best used to communicate simplified figures, ‘caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning.’</a><span class="s27">46 </span>everyday usage may even include using <i>diagram </i>as a synonym for <i>graph</i>, but for our purposes the degree of abstraction from context, phenomenal experience, and spatio-temporal qualia determines the utility of the diagram relative to the context robust map.<a name="bookmark62">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Finally, collage and montage are two examples of image constructions sharing the idea of structure or a set of rules for assembly and legibility, but they aren’t maps.

I don’t want to suggest maps aren’t utilarian, far from it.

The map in early science offers a way to systematically describe or catalogue geographies, but equally, the map was a substitution for the conditions of a place.

They construct order and establish relative relations. Map legibility is internally determined. You need only decipher the key or legend and the internal syntax of the map unfolds. In ‘Theories and Maps’, Stephan Toulmin, a philosopher writing about theories in science, argues the efficiency of maps in providing more information than the set of point- observations constituting their making:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark129" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark69">This, of course, is the marvel of cartography: the fact that, from a limited number of highly precise and well-chosen measurements and observations, one can produce a map from which can be read off an unlimited number of geographical facts of almost as great a precision.</a><a href="#bookmark129" class="s26">52</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">This capacity to ‘read off ‘ unlimited facts has interesting implications. It gives the subject of the map the appearance of objective validity and suggests accurate maps could describe everything.  Taken  to  an  extreme,  the  absurdity  of  this  becomes  apparent  in  Jorge  luis Borges’ thought experiment about the tragic usefulness of the perfect map:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of exactitude in Science</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">...In that empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, and the Map of the empire itself an entire Province.

The map implies or infers spatial organizations projected onto the world. It isn’t exactitude per se but the sufficiency of the model of the world generated by the map. It is clear from Toulmin’s premise, maps do this with little effort. We can’t become enmeshed in the logics of fidelity or mimesis to the lived world when regarding the map. We don’t have to go far to illustrate the point. The map of tesseract by Charles hinton (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 0.11</span>) presents a mathematically determined 4-dimensional figure by definition impossible to see in our 3-dimensional world, however; the simulacra hinton creates helps us to imagine then <i>act </i>on this imagined space.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark129" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark71">This begs the question of the relationship between the map and the territory or idea being mapped. Map-territory relations are key to how designers calibrate observations of place to potential change. The relationship between map and territory describes the correspondence between objects and representations of objects in space. Alfred korzybski’s famous dictum, ‘the map is not the territory,’ points to the essential problem—the representation of the thing is not the thing itself.</a>54 <a href="#bookmark129" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">It is easy to confuse models of reality with reality itself, but designers work in the ‘mental world of maps of maps’ where their drawings act as an infinite set of maps describing ‘thoughts about thinking.’ Adding another layer of complexity: the tools of digital thinking extend the possibility of signs and simulacra to their ‘infinite regress.’ Where early maps or mapping appear to describe appearances mimetically, Jean Baudrillard argues we can no longer delude ourselves: ‘Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation of models of a real without origin or reality: a hyper real. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders the territory.’</a>55 <span class="p">The map is a mirror of our gaze—it is what we allow ourselves to see—not what is seen. representations bear similar burdens of inexactitude, but maps are complex because they claim a kind of veracity or accuracy.

An intuitive perception of higher space would, by rights, help us rid ourselves of the directional location in three-dimensional space reinforcing our sense of self. By ‘casting out the self,’ Hinton believed we would be more sympathetic to others and therefore create greater harmony between experiencers of our shared space.

It is a ‘practice linked with other practices’ allowing us to bring to the foreground types of material objects, historical actors, and their epistemic approach to these objects.

These  categories  are  discrete  entities  with  members sharing a set of properties. recent systems of categorization introduce <i>conceptual clustering </i>and <i>prototype theory</i>. In the former not only are the characteristics (data) about an object taken into consideration, but the language of the description used to define the category is considered. There is some reciprocity therefore, between the objects in a set and the boundaries of the set.

The first is part of the eighteenth-century tradition of phrenology or the art of discerning the nature of a person’s character from their outer appearance with special focus on the face and head. This technique was used as early as the Greeks but recorded comparisons were not produced until the advent of photography. In 1852 James Redfield published comparative engravings between men and animals ideologically charged to underscore contemporary racial hierarchies. In the late nineteenth century Sir Frances Galton</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">refined physiognomic characteristics of health, disease, beauty and criminality by mapping one face onto another using a method of composite photography. The example shown is by C. Lombroso, from <span class="s32">L’Homme Criminal</span>. This is a comparison of ‘révolutionnaires et criminels et politiques—matroïdes et fous moraux (criminal and political revolutionaries—matroid (a finite set) and moral fools). Modern research discredited any scientific value to these studies. However the related area of the study of the human expression of emotions, pioneered by Charles Darwin focusing on the physiological characteristics of expression continues to be debated to this day.

Cognitive  semantics plays a significant role in prototype theory including using metaphor, a powerful linguistic construction relating one idea in terms of another, similar to analogy. Metaphors (like ‘our brains are computers’) determine how we generate and understand information. Mapping as  part  of  the  mechanics  of  making  a  metaphor  establishes  systematic  correspondence between  elements  from  one  domain  to  another  (love  is  a  journey).

The similarity to maps is striking as the translation from statistical data to visual representation involves similar interpolation and interpretation Decisions made in mapping population demonstrates this in so far as they determine categories of race, how and what to aggregate, where there is homogeneity, how to interpret outliers, and how to correlate all of this to a visual perception (see </a>Figure 1.33 <span style=" color: #231F20;">for an analysis of the disambiguation of ‘race’ in the U.S. census).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Moving from an observation about the world to a re-presentation of the world in a map requires mapmakers to categorize content. This seems obvious but, as the previous discussion demonstrates, finding order is also to impose order on the undifferentiated world around us. Designers do this as part of the design process: for every path taken in a given design, countless others aren’t. Assuming informed choices indicates some consideration given in ordering their relative importance. Mapping cognitive structures and their concurrence with possible empirical conditions or conceptual ideation enriches the process enabling designers to manage complex and robust solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Role of the Mapmaker</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Cartographers and geographers generally agree the current frameworks for organizing relationships in maps are limited. Terms like zoning, boundary condition and set theory aren’t robust enough to usefully describe or catalogue a world characterized by complex and culturally specific <i>contexts</i>, dynamic <i>flows </i>and nascent information networks. new forms of mapping (cognitive mapping) and tools for representation (photogrammetry and gIS) allow hitherto unimagined perspectives. This combination of factors qualifies spatial relationships borrowed freely from alternative historiographies to propose new ideologies in the social sciences, professional practices like architecture, urban design and the humanities. The role of mapmaker as hypothesis-maker is evident as we move toward a fourth paradigm in the humanities and sciences. According to Jim gray, the first three paradigms are empirical science describing natural phenomena, theoretical science using models and generalization, and computational science instigated by computers simulating</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="319" height="447" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-01_files/Image_021.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="319" height="452" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-01_files/Image_022.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s31" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark85">0.17</a><a href="#bookmark5" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, </a><a href="#bookmark5" class="s33">0.18</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A catalogue of the physical characteristics of a subgroups of <span class="s32">Radiolaria </span>by Ernst Haeckel from the <span class="s32">Kunstformen der Natur</span>.

Instrumentation for capturing data is sensitive, capable of adjusting to multiple environments and immediately accessible as digital data. Think about documenting a physical condition using a basic tool like the camera. The phone camera takes, processes, manipulates and shares images in a matter of minutes, accomplishing what previously took days in a physical laboratory with skilled technicians. Although the time to get data is shorter, the complexity and amount of data makes curation more difficult. In design fields this means translating sense data, visual observation, data collected through sensors and others devices into legible output impacting the design process. Maps and mapping are one way of doing this. The graphic index (</a>Figures 0.9 <a href="#bookmark63" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a>0.10<a href="#bookmark132" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) has a short but immensely significant history in the sciences with equally productive misreadings in the arts and humanities. For example, the fascination with speed and movement in the sciences at the end of the nineteenth century shares a well-documented influence on the arts. Étienne- Jules Marey’s studies of animal and human movement meant to examine the amount of caloric energy required to perform certain tasks are echoed in artists like Marcel Duchamp, Umberto Boccioni, and giacomo Balla.</a><a href="#bookmark132" class="s26">66</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Finally, analyzing is not only about processing, but entails determining which data to use and what modeling, including data visualization, to perform. looking at all available data in the environment isn’t currently feasible and given predicted growth rates will be impossible without modeling and data visualization technologies to synthesize and organize it. A simple example from building design highlights the problem. Current computer-aided design software can manage aspects of the systems necessary in the documentation of the building  process.  This  replaces  a  paper-based  database,  but  includes  significantly  more information from engineers, contractors and manufacturers. This replaces pre-computer- age  paper-based  databases  and  affords  the  inclusion  of  significantly  more  information from engineers, contractors and manufacturers now embedded in a digital database. Data is used to make simulations that, in turn, generate more data. Most disciplines, including architecture, industrial design, and graphic design are seeing changes as a result of new design software and hardware in two discipline subareas: computational performance and fabrication  concerned  with  collecting,  analyzing,  simulating  and  assembling  objects  and environments,  and  systems  design  focused  on  managing  human  and  social  ecologies. ‘Computational  thinking,’  an  idea  borrowed  from  computer  science,  quickly  radicalized design disciplines and created productive debate around what and how to represent data in the design process. Making complex maps using large datasets is one option enabling designers to bridge the gap between human and machine observation. Maps are efficient, evocative, and indeterminate. They model data well enough for us to infer relations, forecast possibilities, while maintaining data consistency. Additionally, maps are reproducible and transmittable to other designers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Designer as Mapmaker</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Architects and designers are, historically, mapmakers. This next section looks at maps as social inscriptions producing identity; specifically the way designers use maps to provoke new identities of place. For designers, mapping elucidates the gap between representation and territory or context. neil gaiman describes a similar situation in relation to storytelling:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">The way you describe the tale is by telling the story.

Designers and architects are storytellers about the set of possible relations between humans and their environments including their social, political, cultural, and scientific selves imagined in the corresponding spatial arrangement. The configuration of spatial orders reflects and projects the social imaginary of a culture. Designers work in  abstract and geometrical spaces  in their representations to order the world just as cartographers order the terrestrial globe or other territories in the map.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark91">As geometrical constructs, all drawing technologies used in architectural representation are based on projections. Projections as drawing technology allow for the translation from a three-dimensional space to a two-dimensional surface. The orthographic set (plans, sections, elevations) used in design are parallel projections where lines of projection are perpendicular or orthogonal to the drawing surface. Some of the earliest orthographic projections from the second century </a><span class="s36">bc </span><a href="#bookmark133" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">are used in cartography.</a><span class="s27">68 </span>Projections require mathematics to rationalize two-dimensional views—they aren’t techniques, rather technologies giving us precise and measured control over our representations of objects or spaces. Axonometric projections include isometrics or parallel-line projections where the angles between the projections of the axes are equal (120°). Axonometric projections are parallel-line projections used to create a three-dimensional pictorial representation of an object. There are three types of axonometric projections each defined by the angle used in the drawing between the projection of the three coordinate axes: isometric, dimetric and trimetric projections. To understand the ‘projection of the axes,’ imagine the intersection of the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z </i>coordinate axes for a cube. True angles or those in the actual three-dimensional object remain at 90° but in the axonometric drawing space they are represented using other angles. In an isometric drawing the angles at the projection of the axes are 120° which exaggerates the planes of the cube and makes it easer to ‘see’ more of each face of the cube at the same time. In perspective projection parallel lines converge at vanishing points. This projection closely resembles views of the world we see in binocular vision because unlike parallel line projections, perspectival projection lines parallel with the viewer’s line of sight converge at the horizon. Train tracks look this way to us where parallel lines appear to converge in the distance. These drawing technologies are simulations of reality, even perspective: in binocular vision lines are curved, not straight. Designers rarely operate on the thing itself—we use abstract representations of objects to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">manipulate design, construction and production. Through drawing technologies designers create simulations of reality or maps of the territory of the object. In the case of buildings this is easy to understand: each time a designer re-draws a place or object they re-present an abstraction of a territory to themselves upon which they act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Socialist London(s)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The following discussion looks at two very different uses for the map in the design of spatial relationships operating at the scale of a city. The spatial identities of these maps are different even as the geographical locale is the same: post-war london. These map projections are planimetric with similar indices—the functional organization of the city. Patrick Abercrombie’s <i>London: Social and Functional Analysis Map </i><a href="#bookmark92" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(1944) made in post-war london is a large- scale plan for the re-distribution of communities after World War II (</a><a href="#bookmark92" class="s33">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">0.19</span>). Pre- and interwar planning tended to emphasize the functional over the communal. The modernist city plans of le Corbusier projected a technocratic world where circulation and movement (<i>mobilité</i>), guaranteeing function, triumphed over ambiguity, and clarity over indeterminacy (see <span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.19</span><a href="#bookmark93" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). The power of Abercrombie’s map is the inclusion of ‘social’ context—the indeterminate communities loosely floating around the city center providing little descriptive information, but suggesting a city consisting of small villages. note there is little other context in the map: no roadways, very little indication of topography and only minimal geographical clues this is london. Abercrombie’s plan is credited with influencing the growth of the outer ring of suburban development and the depopulation of london after the war. The devastated postwar landscape was reimagined as a regional landscape with a blending of housing and industry, new transport and open spaces (</a><a href="#bookmark93" class="s33">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">0.20</span>). Abercrombie is considered to be one of the last english visionary architect-planners. one other comment: without the map title I argue it would be difficult to identify what city is being represented. The beauty of maps is their paucity—they can communicate complex ideation through carefully selected and measured but minimal indicators.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">In contrast the <i>Plan of London </i><a href="#bookmark94" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(1939–41) by the M.A.r.S. group (Modern Architectural research  group)  (</a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s33">Figure  </a><span style=" color: #00F;">0.21</span>)  was  a  mid-century  British  collaboration  of  architects  and architectural critics. Arthur korn, a german-Jewish architect and urban planner and émigré to england, is the plan’s primary author. The map shows a largely unchanged city center with  the  addition  of  a  series  of  linear  agglomerations  composed  of  social  units  based round a rail network. The linear bands contain neighborhoods of communal housing. The spatial organization of the city in the map mirrors the mapmakers’ socialist ideology and hopes for spatial and social equity through mobility. The modernist notion of movement is interpreted as a spatial network of communications and exchange or transactions drawn in greater detail in the accompanying folio. Although the M.A.r.S. group plan wasn’t adopted it was a successful polemic against the rational and orthogonal city plans promoted before the  war  in  Modernism.  The  map’s  programmatic  organization  was  clearly  influenced  by the  modernist  agenda  of  dwelling,  work,  recreation  and  transport  as  the  primary  urban functions  in  the  city,  however;  the  london  plan  incorporated  these  in  a  new  schematic relationship.

The layout is along a semicircle with buildings arrayed  on  the  outer  arc  of  the  circle  and  across  the  mid-point.  ledoux’s  plan  of  the saltworks resembles his plan for the ideal city of Chaux (</a><a href="#bookmark101" class="s33">Figure </a>0.23<a href="#bookmark133" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) executed some twenty years later in post-revolutionary France.

The first organized all of the buildings around the edges of a square connected by covered walkways.

The plan shows a series of individuated buildings dissimilar from the more typical Baroque organizations of a single massing for multiple programs. The plan for the saltworks included separate structures for guardhouses, a chapel, bakery, prison, workshops for the coopers and the director’s house. The whole ensemble (</a><a href="#bookmark101" class="s33">Figure </a><span class="s31">0.23</span><span class="p">)  is  hierarchical  with  the  director’s  house  at  the  center,  the  saltworks  to  either  side</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="473" height="328" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-01_files/Image_027.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark101">along  the  straight  sections,  quarters  for  the  guards  along  the  arc  with  bathrooms  and vegetable gardens along the backside.

The director’s house in the second plan is akin to the all-watching eye and position of the king in relation to subject. In <i>Discipline and Punish</i>, Michel Foucault explores how in modernity the principles of order and control tend to ‘disindividualize’ powers making it inherent in institutions rather than individuals. For Foucault:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark134" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark105">‘Discipline’ may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, targets; it is a ‘physics’ or an ‘anatomy’ of power, a technology.</a><a href="#bookmark134" class="s26">76</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark134" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark106">For  French  bourgeois  society,  the  king  and  his  representative  agents  are  symbols  of power,  but  in  the  case  of  ledoux’s  saltworks,  this  symbolic  power  becomes  a  spatial practice expressed and molded by the behaviors of its inhabitants. This is the argument Tom Conley makes. he shows issues of cartographic metaphor run through the heart of Western thought—not only maps shape identities and space, but cartographic imagination influences  the  structure  and  content  of  language  and  thought.</a>77    <span class="p">Although  similar  to Foucault’s ‘panoptic machine’ borrowed from seventeenth-century prison reformer Jeremy Bentham, where individuals internalize the technology of the agent, ledoux’s abstraction of the relationship of the individual to power is of another order.

The saltworks organizes the gaze of the king through a director who supervises and commands, but in a symmetric structure: everybody sees the center of the circle and his own place in the whole of the social hierarchy. each ‘body’ understands their role in the larger entity where emphasis is an ideal of government as a matter of personal conduct.</span><a name="bookmark108">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark134" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark109">Borrowing from Foucault, ‘government’ didn’t refer only to political structures or to the management of states; rather it designated the way the conduct of individuals or groups might be directed: the government of children, of souls, of communities, of families, of the sick.

Cooke’s map redraws the geography as pure distance represented as a single scaled line with a few familiar cities. This is the space of a single straight line drawn from coast to coast crossing through St. louis. Similarly, the Beatus or Beatine map (</a><a href="#bookmark181" class="s33">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">1.2</span>) is a medieval <i>mappa mundi </i>presenting a view of the world unfamiliar to modern sensibilities. The map depicts the geography associated with the diaspora of the apostles from accounts given by Ptolemy, St. Isidore of Seville and biblical text. The Beatus is one of the earliest representations of the T and o map (T-o map). These maps are drawn according to the physical characteristics of the world described by Isidore where the inhabited part of dry land is round with a circular ocean dividing it into three parts, Asia, europe and Africa. The circular ocean or ‘o’ is inscribed with the ‘T’ of intersecting channels made between the landmasses. Jerusalem, the <i>umbilicus mundi, </i>is placed as the literal and spiritual center of the world. The garden of eden is located in the eastern end of Asia. This particular map orients eastward rather than the familiar northward. The earth was thought to be a plane sustaining the vault of heaven where the Sun, Moon and other luminaries moved. The waters above the firmament occasionally fell to earth in the form of rain and waters below nurtured the rivers, oceans and seas. however, before you judge the map a representation of a flat world, it should be noted Beatus-type maps are based on the principle the earth is globular, an idea largely accepted by scholars from the time of Aristotle. The T-o maps represent one half of the spherical earth because it was thought impossible to cross the equatorial clime and reach the <i>antipodes</i>, as the unknown lands were called. The map operates on several levels of understanding: 1) a physical description, 2) an itinerary map identifying the travels of the apostles, 3) a map of important biblical events, and 4) a reminder the spiritual center of the earth is Jerusalem.

This map like all maps represents a mode of knowledge as much as an epistemology. If the meaning of the map symbolism is unfamiliar it is because we do not share the same semiotic context as the mapmaker.

Arguably this isn’t a new use of the map.

B harley is one of the first of the critical cartographers to recognize maps are part of a larger problem in the representation of space and the space of representation. he moved beyond the history of the science of mapmaking to consider the practices and social relations underlying the discipline. As Vincent Del Casino notes, ‘harley presents a way of understanding the map and cartography as both parts and products of social discourses and, therefore, employments of power’ where ‘social power is inscribed in maps by cartographers operating within dominant discourses and institutions.’</a>10 <a href="#bookmark238" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">one of the techniques harley introduces is analysis of the entire map including titles, legends, pictures and descriptive text usually placed at the margins of the page.</a>11 <a href="#bookmark238" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">The critique leveled at harley is his assumption the space represented in the map is unproblematic. There are few ambiguities in harley’s view of cartography, ‘no possibility the meaning of the spaces and identities represented in maps may be continually reproduced with changes in context.’</a>12<span class="s44"> </span><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">however, as Del Casino notes, maps are ‘intertextual’: they are made and used in a broad range of existing representations of the place being mapped—I would add this includes histories, cultural biases (unconscious and otherwise), technologies and medias associated with the time and place being mapped.</a>13 <span class="p">Maps, like cities, are what orit halpern calls:</span><a name="bookmark149">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark150">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark151">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark152">an assembling of densities and forms … sites of accumulation in the way Bruno latour speaks of producing ‘immutable’ mobiles and assimilating agents into facts in actor networks, or the way Foucault speaks of visibility—those spaces where representation, practice, technology accumulate—to show things in the world, whether subjects or objects to power.

Mapmakers shouldn’t be expected to manage this with ease or as a syncretic procedure without residual traces, but designers making effective maps hone their observations and direct their desires.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Ontology of the Map</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark153">Since the late 1990s when critical cartography introduced the idea of a political analysis of maps using semiotics, map theorists moved toward the idea maps may not be representations at all. Jeremy Crampton and others suggested the critical cartographers did not go far enough in questioning the ontology of the map.</a>15 <a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">An underlying assumption in harley for instance is maps still have the capacity to tell some kind of truth about a geography—maps aren’t the problem per se, but the people using them.</a>16 <span class="p">Crampton, who turns to heidegger, proposes a ‘non-confessional understanding of spatial representation’ wherein maps instead of ‘being interpreted as objects at a distance from the work, regarding</span><a name="bookmark154">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark155">the world from nowhere, understood as being in the world, as open to the disclosure of things.’</a>17 <span class="p">Invoking heidegger’s notion of ‘being-in-the-world’ suppressing rationality in favor of experience—where being in space and place is like being present (</span><span class="s2">Dasein</span><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">): not as a subject or object of consciousness, but as a projection of possibilities. This openness to the world is a kind of ‘mood’ for heidegger, like the activity of existing that allows us to have a relationship to the world. heidegger resorts to the idea of ‘dwelling’ to explain: to dwell in a house isn’t just to live there, it is to belong there, to be familiar with that place.</a>18 <a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">For Crampton maps represent being-in-space where they codify and give authority to some views, but not others; they write history to the present—‘mapping is a struggle over how to remember the past and to write its biography in maps.’</a>19 <span class="p">The struggle to remember means power is instilled through the mapping of one condition, place, idea, and not another.</span><a name="bookmark156">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark157">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark158">one way of thinking through the idea of the ‘openness to the world’ in design is to consider for a moment the number of possible paths to a solution to any given design problem, be it for a building or industrial object. one way to consider the choice-path assumes a rational set of moves from a raw solution to more refined development making optimal sets of choices until the project is complete. This kind of reductive thinking suggests 1) there are optimal solutions and 2) they are obtained through a rational process, if only the designer can intuit the ‘thingness’ of the object. Being-in-the-world refuses any such directness—the thingness of the objects we encounter isn’t like a Platonic ideal available to us if only we could channel it (see </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figures 4.54 </span>and <span style=" color: #00F;">4.55</span><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). rather it’s our relationship with the world through our representations, including maps, we question—the ontology of the map is at issue, not just the ideologies presented through the map. With respect to maps, the foundational ontology is: the world can be objectively, truthfully and scientifically managed using tools and technologies to capture and display spatial information.</a><span class="s27">20 </span>Assuming, of course, we know what ‘truth’ we are looking for <i>before </i>the initiation of the design process—this is rarely the case in design and certainly more rare now, given the volume of information available. rather than basing the ontological value of the map on its capacity to reflect back to us what we see, we should use the map’s capacity to absorb our varied and ambiguous relationships to the world as process, not representation. Space and place in the work of edward Casey offers another approach to the ontology problem in the map. Casey addresses the philosophical problems of aesthetics, perception, specifically in the discussion of space versus place. Casey debates ‘place over space,’ in that <i>where </i>as much as <i>when </i>matters in history, philosophy, cultural studies and so forth. In <i>Representing Place</i>, Casey proposes that the heideggerian notion of <i>Gebild</i><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, or what makes the world ‘a structured image that restructures the world of which it is an image’</a><span class="s27">21 </span>reveals a fundamental tension between the abstract geometry of space and the phenomenology of place. he critiques the friction between the abstract and universalizing tendencies of modern life and the healing potential of <i>topos </i>within the context of an enlightenment-era worldview extending Cartesian space and time outward from the modern subject. Casey claims there is a loss of a sense of <i>place </i><a href="#bookmark239" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">in modernity, an experience he associates with a pre-modern medieval cosmology. he proposes we recover our lost intuition of place through a careful reading of representations like landscape painting and maps.</a><span class="s27">22 </span><a href="#bookmark240" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Casey considers how ‘representation bears on place’</a><span class="s27">23 </span>and the potential representations of landscapes in paintings and maps have to recover or as Casey terms it ‘re-emplace the human subject in<a name="bookmark159">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark160">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark161">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark162">the </a><i>lifeworld</i>.’ he proposes early maps re-present and in heideggerian terms <i>enframe </i>the lived world and the measured site thus offering a model for how to think about place. In this he makes a general assumption about the unique role of space as a universal precondition for human experience. Casey turns specifically to maps and reminds us the idea of land or ‘landscape,’ as represented in the map is, as William James argues in <i>Essays in Radical Empiricism</i><a href="#bookmark240" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">,  a  ‘palmary  instance  of  the  ambiguous.’</a><span class="s27">24   </span>landscape  maps  are  ambiguous because as a thing in itself, the mapped space can’t be grasped in one instance: not through history or prose, nor through imagination or sense or experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark241" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark163">Casey presents four conditions for representation in the modern era, an age where ‘everything exists together in order to be represented: indeed, exists only as represented.’</a><span class="s27">25 </span>First, the world-as-picture is the same as the world-as-image, and is malleable and makeable. Second, the image world is framed or <i>frameable</i>; and as with maps and paintings, the viewer determines the limits and inclusions. even the sequence of narratives and ordering of memories is determined. Third, objects stand in continual reference to a horizon, either as an event-horizon as the objects’ history or a visual horizon literally or the axis around which perception unfolds. Finally, human beings are the source of all representations; as kant writes in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i><a href="#bookmark241" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, ‘appearances in general are nothing outside our representations.’</a><span class="s27">26 </span><a href="#bookmark241" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Maps are an approximation of reality, a radical notion when we consider heidegger’s assertion that what we believe is reality itself is only an approximation, an image we construct for ourselves.</a><span class="s27">27 </span>Interestingly Casey’s argument also reveals an ontological bias; he assumes a shared and universal sense of <i>place </i>contrary to the notion of being in the world where representation mirrors this sense back to us. In his desire to reclaim a phenomenological ground for place, by inference he claims (like harley) there is a transcendental notion of place- ness to which the human condition is intersubjectively sensitive. If we follow his logic in order to register the effect of the map we must have an a priori awareness, in the kantian sense, that there is such a thing as ‘place’ and the map reflects back to us our innate experience of the differences between space and place. This doesn’t undermine his argument that maps aren’t mirrors of reality, but the map’s approximations partially reinforce our cognitive projections of inherent orders in the world. Some of those orders relate to language and semiotics. It is to these we turn next given they are constitutive elements of maps.<a name="bookmark164">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark165">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Semiotics and Communication</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark241" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark166">Armand Mattelart identifies the convergence between maps, networks and communication as an early concern in the French context starting with the ‘reticular body’ or the network of veins visible on the body.</a>28 <a href="#bookmark242" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">It is part of the link between communication, networks and maps in early modernism arguably continuing to the present in our belief in the salutary effects of telematics or the convergence of computers, television, and telecommunications.</a>29 <a href="#bookmark242" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Mattelart gives as example the military engineer Vauban who imagined a similar kind of reticular representation in the twin mine and countermine technique for assaulting fortified towns. The visible mines or trenches were mapped along with a series of underground tunnels leading to chambers filled with gunpowder detonated to implode the foundations above. By 1825 the Corps of engineers sanctioned the use of the term ‘network’ to describe an articulated system of fortifications, underground passages and communication lines.</a><a href="#bookmark242" class="s26">30</a><a name="bookmark167">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark168">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="456" height="326" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-01_files/Image_033.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark6" class="s33" name="bookmark169">1.3</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ENPC competition map <span class="s32">Trompe l’oeil with the Knave of Spades and the King of Diamonds</span>, map for a 1792 competition held at the French engineering school, the ENPC.

The same engineers from the enPC built the densest optical telegraph network in the world in the late eighteenth century. The link between networks, communication and ideology was instantiated in the map through territories of paths, roads, canals, telegraphs, railways, and in the present, digital optical cables and their attendant infrastructure. For design of the built environment, the wonderfully evocative map of words relating to <i>carte </i>stimulates associations across multiple indices. Spatializing the relationships between words and objects as is possible in maps suggests both a rational order and an erudite act of reading into possibilities that may or may not be rational.

The latter being a product of sensible perception and former a cognitive and apperceptive leap giving us access to meaning and second-level signification in the same way ‘house’ means more than a functional place to reside: house also evokes stability, security, family and safety. robin evans made the same claim for architectural drawings (projections) leading to an awareness of the duality of nature and the mental and drawn image representing and misrepresenting it.</a><a href="#bookmark243" class="s26">3</a><span class="s27">5  </span><a href="#bookmark244" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">In the case of the architecture drawings evans consistently demonstrates the ambiguity of the drawing to the completed building or environment—the appeal to geometry being mostly metaphoric, what is represented in the drawing and what is actualized differ in perceptual, experiential and cognitive dimensions. like Monmonier’s dictum ‘all maps lie,’ evans writes ‘An architecture meaningful in this sense must stand under the cloud that has hung over painting and poetry for millennia: the closer it aligns itself with truth, the more mendacious it becomes.’</a><a href="#bookmark244" class="s26">36</a><a name="bookmark175">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">gunnar olsson called the gap between what goes on within the human mind and what goes on in the world an ‘abyss.’ olsson argued all human reasoning is geographic so in some sense, all reason is also cartographic. he beautifully enumerates his point citing the oldest creation epic yet to be discovered, the Babylonian version of the Sumerian creation story told in the <i>Enuma Elish</i>:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">For the moment, however, all one needs to note is that the very first words of the first line of <i>Enuma Elish</i>—the two words that give the epic its name—are usually translated as ‘When above,’ while the beginning of the second line means ‘And below.’ It is these fix-points of time and place—<i>above</i>, <i>below</i>, <i>when </i>and <i>and</i>—that form the meshes of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark244" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark176">the coordinate net in which the world is both captured and created.

The undifferentiated world cannot be apprehended— it is ‘unnamed’ and undetermined like the </a><i>Enuma Elish</i>. like the fix-points of time and place given above, the map isolates data without fully disrupting the imbedded relationship of some particular data to all other data. The map allows us to slip between whole and part, object and subject, point and ﬁeld, or identity and non-identity on a continuum, rather than as sets or categories which are necessarily deﬁned by contrast, or difference. This positions mapping and  mapmaking  as  effective  tools  for  managing  the  complexity  of  observations  often associated with design in the spatial disciplines. Maps organize qualitative and quantitative data  according  to  the  theoretical  framework  of  the  mapmaker.  Therefore  mapping  is  the collective set of practices structuring correspondence between physical phenomena, lived experience, or conceptual frameworks. To paraphrase lord kelvin who famously noted that to measure something is to understand it: to map something is to structure it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark6" class="s33">1.4</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Re-mapped version of Robert Fludd’s <span class="s32">Map of Consciousness </span>from the <span class="s32">Utrusuque cosmi maioris scilicet et minoris metaphysica, physica atque technica historia </span>(1617–18).

The procedure of deconstructing the map and reconstructing it using the same constitutive parts, but a different projection, alters meaning significantly. The Fludd original uses a perceptual axis of translation. The figure in the map and the surrounding bubbles suggest where in relation to the brain thought and memory occur and in turn the relative position of the brain in the body. This structure gives the parts a hierarchy in relation to each other underscoring Fludd’s metaphysical argument about the order of the relationship between imagination, memory and the spiritual realm. In contrast, Wolff’s map displaces the components into a non-hierarchical field (on the left). They are removed from the pictorial context of the body and treated as icons and the spiritual realm subsumed entirely.

Touch isn’t like other senses; the nerve receptors in the skin carry information about pain and itch.

At one level this applies to the semiotics of the map, the map symbols and signs and, at another, the statistical data or geometric ordering systems. Addressing the first is relatively easy. Dissimilar to language, the spatial and visual symbols assembled in the map are ambiguous. A simple example is symbols denoting ‘city’ on large-scale geographic maps likely don’t indicate the actual size, character or qualities of a given city—they are a substitute for the idea of city and lack specificity. This indeterminacy allows map-signs to operate as qualitative and/or quantitative data, but it begs the question of how correspondence functions in maps.</span><a name="bookmark183">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark184">In general mathematics, correspondence is a relation between two nominal values (</a><i>x, y</i>). Architectural drawings rely on mathematical correspondence. Map projections similarly use projective geometry in which mappings are correspondences between projective ranges. There are many projections in the architectural drawing forms. All projections (perspective, isometric, planimetric) are mathematical transformations creating a new set of <i>x, y </i>(or <i>r</i><a href="#bookmark252" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, ϕ) points from a three-dimensional space to a two-dimensional surface (see </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Chapter 2 </span>for a discussion of projections).

The points <i>x </i>and <i>y </i>are operational in the function, but their correspondence isn’t necessarily represented in the projection. Plotting the map of a waterfront shoreline illustrates the point. The map indicates a correspondence between the line demarcating the shoreline on the map and the relation of the body of water to land determined by empirical evidence—yet that line is a fiction: the rise and fall of tides, shifting land mass, and change at the geologic scale constantly and consistently move the line.

Making inscriptions is a physical and cognitive </a><i>activity </i>taking place equally in the explorer’s hut, the lab, or at a desk with a computer. This is to say: maps are produced in <i>physical places </i>where the scratching of a tree branch against the window, the roughness of the table, or the poor quality of light belies an illusion of a hermetically sealed space in our minds, removed from the <i>experience </i><a href="#bookmark246" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">of the experience. histories of cartography are only beginning, like histories of science and technology, to address what Peter galison identified as one of the ten problems in the history and philosophy of science: context. For galison the best of the recent work in history of science focuses on the practice of science in the field, the laboratory, classroom or shop floor and offers: ‘the opportunity to address … concepts and comportment in specific sites and circumstances without hewing to a vision of what is “truly scientific” or “merely exterior.”’</a><span class="s27">44 </span>he goes on to question what historians actually mean when they invoke context: the context of the text, the nontextual environment be it political, social or ideological. For mapping I would add the perceptual frame of reference for the mapmaker and the map-receiver. This echoes and expands on similar debates in art history from Jonathan Crary’s ‘techniques’ of the observer to Panofsky’s iconology and Arnheim’s notion that vision and perception are active understanding. Including the following discussion of correspondence as an idea in philosophy addresses similar questions about context as a perceptual modality at the core of an ontology of mapping. The desire to inform how we encounter the world and re-present it through the map. how does what is shown in the map correspond to the objects we experience? In other words: what of context is mapped?</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark192">The  traditional  definition  of  correspondence  in  philosophy  is  the  adequation  of  mind to  thing.  husserl  describes  this  as  a  correspondence  of  meaning-intention  to  meaning- fulfillment. our concern is narrowly speaking with the idea that truth exists in relation to reality. In this case, truth is a relational property involving a to-be-specified characteristic related to some specified portion of reality. In traditional cartographic theory this was the mirror principle where maps were assumed to mirror with a high degree of truthfulness the existing usually geographic condition to which they refer. Another way to think about this considered in the early twentieth century by Bertrand russell and g. e. Moore was truth as a correspondence to, or with, a fact. In relation to the way maps are received this is interpreted as the notion of an </a><i>isomorphism </i><a href="#bookmark246" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">between the inner natures of the corresponding items where the structure of the corresponding items needs to be sufficiently similar or the same.</a><span class="s27">45  </span>Mapping as a cognitive skill suggests that this is the case. What I am examining and re-presenting as a mapmaker is sufficiently similar for me to recognize, communicate, and disseminate it to others. Much as Bruno latour ‘holds the focus steady’ on visualization and cognition in the lab, map makers hold steady to the idea there is a correspondence between what is seen and what is mapped. But given what is known about the complexity of perception and the relativism of the experience of the world, looking at correspondence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">62</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Maps as Objects of Explanation</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">begs the question of how sufficiently similar items are to each other for the mapped condition to be valuable enough for us to act on it.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark193">Turning again to husserl offers insight. looking to the experiential qualities of bringing together  thought  and  objects,  husserl  uses  the  term  ‘fulfillment’  (</a><i>Erfullungssynthesis</i><a href="#bookmark247" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). The synthesis of fulfillment does not give us access to truth itself, but does make truth intuitively present to reflective consciousness.</a><a href="#bookmark247" class="s26">4</a><span class="s27">6  </span>however correspondence isn’t matching the perception and the conception of the object—the thing-in-itself is radically different from  our  perception  of  it.  As  Dallas  Willard  explains,  ‘The  “match  up”  here  between the  consciousness  and  the  object  is  not  between  the  thought  of  the  object  and  the perception  of  the  object,  but  an  identity  of  the  partial  intentions  or  meanings.’  This  is an  <i>intentionalistic  </i>correlation  between  the  meanings  in  the  encompassing  act  through which the object is bodily present as are its constituents (parts, properties, structures), so  ‘It  is  <i>this  </i><a href="#bookmark247" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">correspondence  that  husserl  determines  to  be  a  kind  of  truth,  and  which can be made “bodily present” by reflection on cases where the synthesis of fulfillment is  carried  out.’</a><a href="#bookmark247" class="s26">4</a><span class="s27">7   </span>To  understand  how  this  would  work,  imagine  making  the  observation ‘There is a mountain in the landscape.’ The thought is separate from the object (reality). It could be a big, small, green, or snow-capped mountain—not included in the thought, but included in the embodied perception. The perception is the same as the thought but with the added information of the bodily presence of the parts, properties, and structures of the object—once this is brought to consciousness the intention of cognition is fulfilled. For husserl perception will in every case be a process developing through time under the guidance of thought. Finally there is reality or what he calls the ‘state of affairs’ consisting of there <i>being a mountain in the landscape</i><a href="#bookmark247" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">. For husserl this four-part definition of truth as correspondence constitutes the living synthesis of fulfillment or the correspondence between thought and object. Consciousness that the state of affairs is being perceived as the corresponding thought ‘represents’ it opens the mind to the ‘bodily presence’ of, as husserl terms it, the ‘thing itself.’ For husserl, as with the map, the truth of a thought about an object is always the same—it does not depend on whether we bring it before abstract consciousness through the concrete experience of fulfillment or not—truth isn’t a matter of consciousness at all.</a><a href="#bookmark247" class="s26">48</a><a name="bookmark194">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark195">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s31" style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark197" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">The map in </a>Figure 1.18 <span style=" color: #231F20;">by Samantha Stein exemplifies how correspondence works in the domain of cartographical thinking.

The ecological approach asks what an organism (human organism) needs to know about their environment and how it might be known. Stein’s map isolates characteristics of transformational invariants identified by gibson such as attention, weighting and contrast. A transformational invariant is the kind of change in the proximal stimulus specifying the change to us, as it seems to occur in the object (spinning, walking, jumping, etc.). Thus from Michaels and Carello:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark247" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark199">if an event is something happening to something, the ‘something happening’ is presumed specified by transformational invariants while the ‘something’ is presumed described by structural invariants.</a><a href="#bookmark247" class="s26">50</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The ‘something happening’ in the map is the way the observer experiences the view from the road. gibson’s ecological perception is akin to husserl’s fulfillment where objects brought to bear on consciousness through concrete experience are made bodily present through reflection. Stein’s map isolates specific characteristics of reflection letting her ‘slow’ the process of reflection down in order to make conscious a perceptual experience of the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">If correspondence addresses how mapping helps organize relationships between objects including objects in the world and human-as-object in the world, the next question is how do we characterize these relationships in themselves? how do we constitute ourselves as objectively existing subjects in relation to other experiencing subjects or the objective spatio-temporal world? Again, the discussion turns to philosophy and we borrow from husserl and transcendental phenomenology to unpack the problem, but using map examples should help make the applications to the problems in cartographical thinking accessible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Intersubjectivity and the Relationship of Things or Ideas</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark200">We will take a phenomenological turn and borrow husserl’s notion of </a><i>intersubjectivity </i><a href="#bookmark247" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">in order to understand how maps activate a relationship between two discrete conditions, sets, or domains.

The objects that are the subject of the map are rich, varied and difficult to categorize. The problem becomes apparent in the atlas. Is the atlas a collection of ideal conditions or exemplar conditions? Ideal conditions imply an average or mean of various types where the exemplar is a single specimen used to demonstrate typical characteristics. Intersubjective relations occurring as spatially dependent phenomena between bodies are characterized as identities. Identities are always constructed in relation to something else.

This ‘cartographical psychesthenia’ isn’t representational mirroring, but a confusion of self, described by Caillois where:<a name="bookmark208">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark209">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 168pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark250" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark210">The feeling of personality, considered as the organism’s feeling of distinction from its surroundings, of the connection between consciousness and a particular point in space, can’t fail under these conditions to be seriously undermined; one enters into the psychology of psychasthenia, specifically of legendary psychasthenia, if we agree to use this name for the disturbance in the above relations between personality and space.</a><a href="#bookmark250" class="s26">59</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">This assimilation to the surroundings is compounded when the view in the map is remote.

Context used in the map means ‘subjects’ in the map the mapmaker brings into focus and the subjects used at the periphery to sustain the totality of the mapped representation. The ‘neutral domain’ is the empty place on the map: the area not filled with text or visual imagery. In terrestrial maps this is the middle of the ocean, the edges of the map left seemingly empty by the mapmaker, or the imaginary space indicated but not framed by the map. Context as neutral domain is both theoretical and applied. For a historian, the intellectual history of context covers ground in many disciplines and generally refers to sources. For disciplines addressing the built environment, context is an applied problem referring specifically to the conditions of place. But rather than think of theory and application in opposition, mapping as a mode of knowledge offers an alternative intellectual construct where context is a kind of <i>neutral domain. </i>neither the internalist versus externalist opposition framed in the history of science or solely a question of a literal physical place, but interplay between any and all of the actors and their psychology, geography and environments.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark251" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark220">We return to Peter galison’s argument about context in the history and philosophy of science.</a>63 <a href="#bookmark251" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">he posed the question to challenge how historians use context—this isn’t as dissimilar to the way the neutral domain works in the map as one might think. For history, context includes texts, nontextual sources, intellectual, historical and periodic content, but a list of resources alone can’t answer the question of how a contextual explanation works. Theoretical constructs for the content of context outline the same condition of context in the map, namely it’s use as a framework to support ideological content indexed through explicit markers. remember however the map is a product of the mapmakers’ and map- readers’ psychological, physical, and perceptual cognitive references. There isn’t internality or externality in the map—there is only a correspondence. Contextual explanations work because they help us point to the subject. If we want to talk about a particular painting we might explore the intellectual, social, and material area around it: what genre or style, the immediate circumstances and aesthetic conditions (what do the paintings from that time period look like, who wrote about them), physical media and constraints, local conditions, who bought them— these questions are our initial frame. once frame is established you eliminate or add supports to shore up a historical explanation. This reminds me of Michael Baxandall’s exhortation that we don’t explain pictures: we explain remarks about pictures, or rather, we explain pictures only in so far as we have considered them under some verbal description or specification.</a>64 <span class="p">Description is the mediating object of explanation and the neutral domain acts as description does to mediate the theoretical and literal contexts of the map.</span><a name="bookmark221">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The <i>Timeline of Race and Ethnicity in the US Census </i><a href="#bookmark223" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 1.33</span>) illustrates the problematic of the neutral domain when looking at historical conditions surrounding the construction of race.

Instead, the phenomenon of space results from the being-in or living-in space. This concept has profound consequences for architecture as the focus shifts from the geometry of spatial relations to the social, environmental, and geographical character of specific locales and the psychoanalytic and somatic relationships between our daily built environment and the body. For example, Bachelard emphasizes the ‘poetics’ of space embedded in memory and body awareness. The horizontal/vertical dialectic is identified with the upright stance of our body, the relationship between earth and sky, and the dynamic effect of diagonal forms that pull against these axes. opposed to this is the inside/outside dialectic ordered along the lines of enclosure/openness, safety/danger, familiar/strange, and private/public. These spatial constructs organize the outer world with the conceptual/mental world.

C. Tolman, James J. gibson and kenneth Boulding to reimagine cities through the cognitive map in <i>The Image of the City</i><a href="#bookmark251" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">.</a><span class="s27">69  </span><a href="#bookmark251" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Mental maps or mental models are created as the individual acquires, codes, stores and recalls images or information about specific phenomena and locations in everyday environments. Tolman hypothesized legibility in this mental schema produced well-adjusted human beings—a legible and clearly defined environment engenders better cognitive maps in its inhabitants. lynch applied this theory to the image of the city stating clearly  defined  boundaries  between  districts,  edges,  paths,  and  landmarks  contribute  to the clarity of the cityscape. The designer’s role is to organize the city by managing legibility for the user. Cities like Boston with clear edges are naturally more legible than places like los Angeles or newark, nJ. Similarly Boulding argued that behavior, especially of humans, is not a product of a particular stimulus but of the whole image of the world in the mind of the behaving person.</a><span class="s27">70  </span><a href="#bookmark235" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Cooke’s map (</a><a href="#bookmark235" class="s33">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">1.38</span>) catalogues a <i>dérive</i>, or rapid passage through varied ambiences taken by the mapmaker through a public plaza in Venice, Italy. The  map  is  a  series  of  tourist  photos  taken  at  random,  based  on  objects  that  drew  the mapmaker’s attention—in effect their cognitive map. The map charts the path in plan and then reconfigures the plaza based on the perception of the space tracking locations where photographs were taken. The photos act as placeholders for the things noticed or catalogued in the mental model of the mapmaker. Cooke’s map inverts this relationship to show how distorted the space of the images would be if you redrew the plaza according to the order of the ‘image’ of the place represented by the photographs. While the experience is ordered— it makes sense based on the relative location of the attributes of the perceptual phenomena, a geometrically rationalized space of these same phenomena would not present itself as an ordered spatial configuration. The disjunction between the two modes, the cognitive map on the one hand and the spatial map on the other, highlight the complexity of mapping places. Places, context or what I call the <i>neutral domain </i>in the map refuse to yield to any one ‘operational technique.’ A problem identified by James Corner regarding planning and urban design is:<a name="bookmark233">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark251" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark234">while there is no shortage of theory and ideas for addressing this condition critically, there has been very little development of new operational techniques for actualizing them.

But what is the territory? operationally, somebody went out with a retina or a measuring stick and made representations which were then put on paper. What is on the paper map is a representation of what was in the retinal representation of the man who made the map; and as you push the question back, what you find is an infinite regress, an infinite series of maps. The territory never gets in at all. … Always, the process of representation will filter it out so that the mental world is only maps of maps, ad infinitum.</p><p style="padding-left: 322pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">gregory Bateson, <i>Steps to an Ecology of Mind</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 149pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Maps Communicate: Ordering, Weighting, Reducing</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 149pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Although built on the messiness of nature, the map as a graphic representation of the milieu communicates  ways  in  which  societies  around  the  world  and  throughout  time  interpret their  known  world.  even  if  we  imagine,  as  gregory  Bateson  does,<span class="s27">1   </span>an  infinite  regress where maps are built upon maps—at any given time we share versions of these messy and complex interpretations of our world. Maps are one of Bruno latour’s <i>immutable mobiles </i>or  representations  scaling  down  and  inscribing  places,  ideas,  or  things  so  they  can  be transported back to the center and combined with other objects.<span class="s27">2 </span>The map is latour’s favorite example of a scientific representation. Acknowledging that for latour maps are generally understood as geographical representations and not, as I am arguing, representations of any possible milieu (as place, idea or thing); following on his explanation we can apply the same conceptual structure to the map broadly considered. For latour the cycle of mapmaking starts with the explorer who sets out in a ship laden with equipment to draw a new land, and then returns home and shares the knowledge captured in the map with other explorers who in turn make new maps. repeated explorations render additional and refined maps brought back  to  the  center  of  scientific  and  political  inquiry.  The  map  reinforces  an  imperialistic relationship between the authority requesting the map and the territories at the periphery. This example identifies several levels of ordering: the way the graphic representation orders information about place, literally, identifying places and features; and the way the map as an object of explanation orders the social relationships represented by the mapmaker and places and people the mapmaker records. The order of the map as the mapmaker conceives</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Terms of the Map</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark253">it projected onto the territory or place while the map itself orders our knowledge of it. This highlights maps as social as well as scientific productions and as graham Burnett points out, painstakingly crafted through ‘the explorer’s active engagement with the land.’</a><span class="s27">3  </span>This active engagement  is  literal  and  embodied:  the  explorer  comes  from  somewhere  and  goes  to measure something, but it is also symbolic—an active perceptual or cognitive engagement on the part of the mapmaker reveals as much about what is included as excluded from the contents of the map. Maps are objects of historical explanation encoding the context of their making. To extend latour’s example, his explorer ate something for lunch, brought with him beliefs and biases, and engaged in measuring using tools produced from the materials of his own context. Scientific tools, technology, cultural morays and bias are but a few conditions shaping how maps are made or transmitted. It is important to emphasize because maps are constructed using instruments and particular representational technologies like projection and perspective lending them scientific authority. Maps are mostly mobile but they are not as immutable as latour suggests. Although latour was using maps to exemplify an argument about the cycles of accumulation in science and engineering it is the subject of another book to determine if the analogy would hold both ways. The claim here is mapmaking is a context- dependent activity similar to any semiotic practice dealing with signs and symbols shifting according to time and place.<span class="s27">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">one question is how do maps <i>weigh </i>or assess and <i>reduce </i>or limit information to convey knowledge about a place or idea? This asks what is different about the way a map conveys information than other kinds of graphical tools. Consider first that maps articulate information about space and location, ideas and concepts and any possible combination of data sets in a given milieu through <i>form </i>and <i>content</i>. Form is made up of the characteristics of type used in its core symbolizing activity. erwin Panofsky uses the example of perspective as a core symbolizing activity in art.<span class="s27">5 </span>Perspective drawing is a form based in the rules of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="304" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-01_files/Image_069.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 367pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark8" class="s33">Diagram 2.1</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 367pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perspective drawing diagram.</h2></body></html>
