The content of the perspective is the milieu: city view, landscape or inside of a coffee cup. The contents of the map (perspective) may change—index different information, but the formal rules determining the way this view is constructed will be the same regardless of what is represented. Joan Blaeu’s map of enkhuisen (</a><span class="s1">Figure 2.8</span><span class="p">) is a good example. The map uses perspective form and a kind of extruded view similar to an isometric form with the same contents. other map forms or types include thematic maps or choropleths in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, to planimetric maps that flatten topographic differences in a landscape to show plane measurements including angles, distances and areas. Form and map type are not synonymous. A map may include several forms as the Blaeu map does, and map types may share formal similarities as a planimetric map shares with orthographic projections—the plan, section and elevation drawings in architecture. What is important is the mapmaker considers that different formal structures convey differing aspects of the same data, e.g. a tree in plan looks very different from a tree shown in perspective or the quantity of tree leaves shown as a graphic bar in a choropleth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">looking at <i>North America in Eight Projections </i>and <i>Three Map Projections Centered at 39 N and 96 W </i><a href="#bookmark0" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(</a><a href="#bookmark0" class="a">Figures 2.1</a> <a href="#bookmark2" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.2</span>) demonstrates how the form of the map can change the way the contents are understood by the map reader.

The Mitchell Map underscores this idea (</a>Figure 2.4<span style=" color: #231F20;">). Shown are two possible maps of the eastern seaboard in the United States in north America. The first is a generalized sense of the shape of the topography; the second is a generalized representation of the outlines of the original boundaries. Projections used to create both views are literally geometries built into the representations reducing the representation from all possible information available (type of soils, number of people, roadways, smell of the grass) to two particular conditions: topography and boundary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">If we accept maps engage in reordering the world, then they are implicated in how we construct our identity in the world. By default they order the world according to man’s relationship to man, nature and society as these are the only points of view the human species can adopt—we wouldn’t be very good at seeing the world from the perspective of a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">beetle. Maps fix geographic, social, political, material and cultural boundaries—in short they mediate between thought and the objects of thought. Bring to mind a map of the world—if you imagine countries checkered across a sheet with pinks and blues, you are thinking the place and boundary defining the place at the same time. Say you imagine the shape of the countries within a continent: it is hard to think one (shape) without naming the other, to say “African continent” without thinking the place/shape. But on reflection, these are not stable entities—country boundaries, even names of continents, are socially, not naturally constructed. Maps represent the thoughts <i>we project </i>about the way the world is organized, not the actual world. Using an example from architecture or urbanism: the word-thought ‘city’ reaches a crisis when the boundaries of cities are no longer clear—when the modern metropolis includes physical, social and culturally amorphous boundaries between nature, digital information, economic influence, and political resonance.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 144%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark11">As representations of the world as we perceive it, maps are </a><i>symbolic forms</i><a href="#bookmark63" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">. ernst Cassirer suggested symbolic forms might be open and active.</a><span class="s5">13 </span>According to Cassirer</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="494" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_006.gif"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 372pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.6</p><h2 style="padding-left: 372pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagram illustrates the difference between ideal and actual space.

This is the world constructed out of our sense perceptions in relation to our spatio-temporal position in the world. Another way to think about this is how maps communicate what we draw from our memories, desires and observations. on the one hand the map is a representation of a place or idea, a catalogue of the hills, valleys, plains, cities, streets and names used to communicate something or some idea to someone else. on the other it is a projection or representation, not a recreation. The map ‘precedes the territory’ in so far as it fixes the possible against the probable especially in memory. The map points to a world we determined from our sense perception and recomposed into a representation. Just like our perceptions and memories maps won’t include everything. World maps don’t include the world, but a simulacra of the world: a representation of the shadow of the world—a bare outline of the mapmaker’s reduction of three-dimensional world-elements onto a two- dimensional plane. The important characteristic is not that maps reduce the world, but how. What is included, excluded, emphasized or muted reveals how the cartographer thinks-the- world. When the mapmaker is a designer, this means what is mapped is what is thought in relation to the design-hypothesis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data Visualization, Mapping, and Measuring</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark12">Measuring from the latin </a><i>mens </i><a href="#bookmark64" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">means to ascertain quanta—size, amount, and degree—of something generally using instruments calibrated with standard units. In the sciences, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of a measurements quantity to that quantity’s true value.</a><span class="s5">14  </span>It may be correct to think of the <i>precision </i><a href="#bookmark64" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">of the map: the degree  to  which  repeated  measurements  under  unchanged  conditions  show  the  same results, but with the added caveat a high degree of precision cannot be expected under most  circumstances.  Maps  measure  in  the  same  way  photography  captures  the  image. Very convincing to the eye, but upon closer inspection they are a construction of reality not a replication. Denis Cosgrove stressed ‘the measure of mapping is not restricted to the mathematical; it may equally be spiritual, political or moral.’</a><span class="s5">15  </span>When working with a map it is important to consider what is being measured and why as much as when. If you imagine trying to draw the high tide watermark <i>as precisely as possible </i>the problem becomes clear. Where to fix the line, in relation to what, and which line to consider the definitive wave are subjective decisions—made through observation even using calibrated instruments. They can never be definitive given for a terrestrial map the curvature of the earth makes locating any point by a single two-dimensional grid impossible.<a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Why is mapping useful in making decisions when collecting, calibrating, organizing and acting on information about the world? The utility of mapping as a form of data visualization isn’t in accuracy or precision, but rather the map’s capacity to help us make and organize hypothesis about the world of ideas and things. hypothesis-making through the map isn’t strictly inductive or deductive, although it can use the thought process of either, but it is often based on general observations. The observation, for instance for a painter, will likely be sense oriented and perceptual, but for a scientist, mathematical and rational. The data is a set of quantitative values in the latter and qualitative variables in the former. natural signs and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">language operate along a continuum between what is quantifiable and what is qualifiable. Qualia may be determined by <i>just noticeable differences </i>or the amount something must be changed for a difference to be noticeable, say between yellow and yellower, or pretty and prettier. For the map these relative differences are easy to convey and adequate to show some  kind  of  difference.  Similarly,  ideas  like  justice  or  love  can  be  mapped  as  relations between sets of ideas or actions if the internal logic of the relations is maintained in the map. love may include jealousy, passion or desire, but likely does not include all cats in your neighborhood with yellow tails. Any observation may be mapped if the mapmaker is willing to index it or create a relationship between one set of data and another.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark64" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark14">Visualizing data in the map can be done using any kind of data, but there are some distinctions between types of data that are important. Data in the sciences appear to be concrete and empirical, for instance the speed and direction of a particle, whereas data in the humanities tend to be ‘situated, partial and constitutive.’</a>16 <span class="p">Closer examination shows data should be considered in relation to the context of the observation along a continuum including or excluding modifier information as needed. For example, maps used primarily for road travel include data points for roads represented as simple lines whose width may indicate, but not mathematically represent actual road widths.</span><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark14" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark16">This perceptual ‘distance between’ drawn into the map is less rational, more psychological, individual, particular, but often less consciously apparent.

Without context in which to contemplate the data, the meaning is impossible to determine. The numbers ‘12:01’ are quantitative when they indicate a numerical value, but qualitative when used as a title of a thing, like a movie. Maps contain multiple instances of packets of data that must be characterized in a context before they are legible to the reader. The presence of a structure also distinguishes maps from diagrams, similar to maps in kind, but not degree.</a>17 <a href="#bookmark65" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Diagrams don’t quantify or qualify spatio-temporal relationships.</a>18 <span class="p">The specific tools used to manage and contextualize data in the map, the relationship between the form and content of the map, and how they communicate to the map-reader is what we turn to next.</span><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Determination of the Four Elements and Two Functions</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The four operative terms and two functions necessary to the organization of the map are: 1)</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">frame<span class="p">, 2) </span>axis of translation<span class="p">, 3) </span>projection <span class="p">or relative scale, 4) </span>index<span class="p">; and the two functions:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="473" height="144" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_007.png"/></span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Diagram 2.2</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">time <span class="p">and </span>place<span class="p">.

They are universal structures replicated in all maps to varying degree. Map types may differ—world maps, celestial maps, subway maps— but their DnA uses these same building blocks. The mechanics of the visual apparatus constituting the tools of cartography are surprisingly replicable for all maps. Different authors use varying terminology, scale instead of projection or legend instead of index, but general agreement about the characteristics of maps prevails.</a><span class="s5">19 </span>not all maps have every term but every map has at least two: frame and index, without these they present a mere picture not a representation of a milieu. A caution, even relatively innocuous terms can be difficult: for instance <i>scale </i>which puts things in relative relationship can also be means to include or exclude content, similarly, <i>time </i>has a number of variables across several levels of meaning in the map.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frame</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark65" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark19">Maps are parenthetical—maps frame what you want to hold apart from the real in the world. Maps do this by creating conceptual representations of the milieu using symbols and relations between symbols. Cartographers call this symbol correspondence the index, but it is the same representational strategy as spatial correspondence, the difference only becoming evident when the map describes a spatial milieu.</a>20 <a href="#bookmark65" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Unlike the symbols in language the map is a code derived from graphic symbols and it is from these it’s particular ambiguity or indeterminacy derives. This indeterminacy allows maps to operate as qualitative and/or quantitative research instruments.</a><a href="#bookmark65" class="s3">21</a><a name="bookmark20">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Maps, any map and every map, begin with a frame. This is the literal and conceptual demarcation between what is in the map and what is not. Making a map begins with an observation which is both a thought about thinking and the object of thought itself. The undifferentiated world cannot be apprehended, therefore; all maps have a frame whether a concept or a cosmography. This is one of the ﬁrst principles of the map identiﬁed by the Milesian philosopher Anaximander (c.610–c.546 <span class="s7">bce</span>). To map the world Anaximander suggested beginning with a frame twice as long as high—within which the known world or <i>oikoumene </i>would be demarcated; everything else, the <i>ge, </i>or remainder, would be outside the map. enframing parenthetically marks content, whether the subject is physical, as in human DnA, cities or the cosmos, or metaphorical, as maps of desire, or the road less traveled. To begin to think about an object, you must separate, identify and somehow contain it. like the <i>Kunstkammer </i><a href="#bookmark21" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">or cabinet of curiosities framing a particular collection of objects removed from the world, the mapmaker enframes the data they want to observe (</a><a href="#bookmark21" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.7</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="269" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="348" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark21">To extend the comparison, the data framed by the map, like the cabinet, can be added to, subtracted, re-ordered, multiplied and divided—but the frame identifies the contents as part of </a><i>this </i><a href="#bookmark23" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">order, not another.

Blaeu controls the data in the map (city streets, buildings, sea, boats, boundaries) using several formal structures in order to highlight the concept, or argument, of the map. notice city streets and buildings are shown planimetrically with some extrusion to indicate their volumetric characteristics so the map-reader will be able to use the map to understand the general organization of the city. But areas where there are ships (the sea and the larger canals) the image is in perspective. This distortion of the picture space is handled deftly so the map is read seamlessly between these two axes but the effect is to highlight the importance of the port or places the ships travel to and from. In a Dutch municipality of the time this would have been of especial importance. The map is a claim about the relative value of this city as part of a larger collection of cities critical to Dutch sea trade in the mid-seventeenth century.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Axis of Translation</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The second term is the axis of translation or the rotational plane about which the mapped representation is viewed. This is usually either a horizontal or vertical viewing plane. The cabinet of curiosities is again a useful analogy. Just as the cabinet is viewed in the vertical or perceptual field, the map can work in this dimension or in the familiar horizontally viewed cognitive plane rationalized and ordered onto a two-dimensional surface. This axis of orientation is associated with spatial ordering like the orthographic geometries (plan, section and elevation), planimetric and topographic maps. We look at specific map projection types next but suffice it to say a horizontal axis of translation appears in any map using a parallel</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="320" height="278" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 259pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">Diagram 2.4</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 259pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagram illustrating the horizontal and vertical axes of translation.</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: right;"><a href="#bookmark24" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark25">projection where projection lines are orthogonal to the picture plane (</a>Diagram 2.4<a href="#bookmark66" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). This kind of projection creates a rationalized space where the point of perspective of the map viewer is at infinite distance from the picture plane. In an orthographic projection all light rays or projection lines remain parallel to each other and perpendicular to the picture plane. The vertical axis of translation is a perceptual axis associated with perspectival views.</a><span class="s5">23 </span><a href="#bookmark36" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">This projection is most often a constructed perspective projection or a view seen through the lens of a camera. Unlike orthogonal projections light rays in perspective projection converge at the horizon for the map viewer. As seen in </a>Figure 2.18<a href="#bookmark26" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, the horizon line passes through the eye of the two standing figures in this early illustration of the rules of perspective. Shown is a one-point perspective in which all lines converge at the vanishing point, in this case, the eye- point of the figure at the back door. note the human figures are themselves not in perspective, but simply placed into a perspectival space. Their size is determined according to rules of relative scale, but the compound curves constituting their bodies are approximations, not calibrated geometries. The camera is a special case of perspectival projection where the camera lens is very similar to the human eye, but the type of lens curvature, convex or concave, is a synthetic operation with view types unique to each. The field of focus is controlled by the relationship between the focal length of the lens, the distance from the object, the placement of the focal plane and the amount of light. The relationship between the visual field relative to the distance from the object (</a>Figure 2.9<span style=" color: #231F20;">) literally where the camera is placed and the focal length or focus function of the camera and resulting image registering</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">on the picture plane was mapped by one of my undergraduate students.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark27" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">not all maps include every term. For example genetic maps don’t depend on the axis of translation, they rely on the idea of indexing, in their case indexing protein sequences to organic genomes. Maps showing us a measured view of objects in space like perspective are of the vertical plane variety. Maps assuming an infinite number of possible points of view, as most street maps do, are of the horizontal plane variety.

In <span class="s2">Variable Grain</span><a href="#bookmark28" class="s20">, the distance between points is measured in time (</a><a href="#bookmark28" class="s6">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.11</span>). The map highlights the constant change in topography along any given path through the city and the time of the movement from one view to the next. The filmic quality of spatial experience is emphasized by the images presented to the viewer. <span class="s2">Psychogeographic Mapping </span><a href="#bookmark30" class="s20">(</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 2.13</span>) uses the same premise as the eponymous <span class="s2">Psychogeographic Map</span></h2><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of Paris <a href="#bookmark87" class="s20">by Guy Debord (see </a><span class="s8">Figure 3.23</span><span class="h2">). But rather than offering a planimetric view of any possible unplanned journey or Situationist </span>dérive <span class="h2">through the city, as Debord does, this map focuses on the continuum of the experience of one possible path and the sense of disorientation experienced due to the constant change in topography in Genova.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 152pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The negotiation between these two axes reveals our assumptions about the ‘spaceness’ of space both in the map and in our thinking. In this example, the student mapmaker wanted to highlight the relationship of natural and built infrastructure, a large river, and the roadways respectively. The plan view helps you locate them in space while the perspectival view highlights their relationship to a particular place: the red dot marking the location of the building site.

In the two maps, <i>Variable Grain </i>and <i>A Psychogeographic Mapping of Genoa</i>, student teams collected images with cameras walking through the city, however, their interpretations of the data are distinct. In <i>Variable Grain </i><a href="#bookmark29" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">students tracked the changes in the horizon based on single frames from camera photographs (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 2.11</span><a href="#bookmark29" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). Photos were organized sequentially to graphically highlight the changes in the horizon as indicated by the red lattice (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 2.12</span>). The movement from one place to another is tracked and noted based on walking times. The effect on the observer is a sense of the general flow of the change in topography and the associated views in the perceptual field.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark31">The </a><i>Psychogeographic Mapping of Genoa </i><a href="#bookmark30" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">uses the same initial idea of walking in the city to develop a general understanding of place but the students opted to emphasize the sense of disorientation by shifting the photographic stills against a consistent datum, in this case the horizon (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 2.13</span>). The horizon line drawn in red is contrasted to the actual change in topography (black line) and the continuous shift in view highlights the strange and phantasmagoric quality of walking through an unfamiliar territory. Both maps highlight the use of the idea of the frame. The frame of the route or path is clearly identified in the maps and the photographic stills frame fixed views re-assembled according to a new set of rules created by the mapmakers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Projection and Relative Scale</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark31" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">The third term is projection used to control relative scale. Projection is a systematic transformation of information from a three-dimensional condition into locations on a two- dimensional plane. The myth of the origin of painting begins with Dibutades outlining the projection of the image of her departing beloved (</a>Figure 2.14<span style=" color: #231F20;">). She traces his profile on a</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.14</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="351" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a tradition documented by Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder, <span class="h4">ad</span><span class="s9">23–79) a potter’s daughter from Corinth named Dibutades was the first person to make a projected drawing. Dibutades was distraught over her beloved’s departure on a long trip and wanted an impression by which to remember him.</span></h2><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She marked the contour of his head on a wall following along the shadow outline produced by lamplight. She asked her father to make a ceramic vase following the</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">contours of the profile. From the myth we actually understand two procedures. The first is projection, where all drawing</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is a form of shadow casting or ‘light blocking’ with the tip of a drawing tool. The second is the translation back to three</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dimensions using the measured projection allows for an object of relative proportion to the original. Both procedures are fundamental to the process of mapping or the mental act of projecting a map.

This is the essence of projection: you imagine a light source passing through a grid placed over a three-dimensional object and registering onto a two-dimensional plane (</a>Figures 2.15<a href="#bookmark34" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, </a>2.16 <a href="#bookmark35" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a>2.17<a href="#bookmark35" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). If we imagine wrapping a cone or cylinder (like the one shown in </a>Figure 2.17<span style=" color: #231F20;">) around an object, the surface can be unrolled to a plane. The resulting grid allows a cartographer to extrapolate coordinates corresponding to features of the original object. You can project onto a plane tangent to the object, but must select a point of perspective from outside of the object. This is the same procedure used to create perspective views where an imaginary plane is placed between the observer’s viewpoint and the object being viewed. The </span><span class="s4">aspect </span><span style=" color: #231F20;">or orientation of the plane is the angle at which a plane, cone, or cylinder is placed relative to the object. In perspective this is always perpendicular at a 90-degree angle to the surface of the object or view. For world maps the aspect may be normal so the axis of symmetry coincides with the earth’s axis, transverse at right angles, or oblique, any angle between these two.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark32">In  terrestrial  maps  the  </a><i>graticule  </i>or  grid  of  longitudes  and  latitudes  controls  the transformation of locations from the geode or ellipsoid representing the earth on a plane. longitude and latitude are geographic coordinates transformed to Cartesian (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) or polar plane (<i>r, ϕ</i><a href="#bookmark36" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) coordinates. Imagine slicing an orange skin so you could press it onto a piece of paper. The problem is how to manage a measured set of relationships between the parts of the orange skin as you tear it in order to flatten it. The most common device used to control the relationships between objects in the map is the grid. This divides the frame in such way as to scale objects relative to each other within the world of the map. The grid is akin to an atomist structure: it is the building block for the order of the map. The power of the grid is best explored using a perspectival grid. Perspective depth can be created relatively easily. If two objects are overlapped in a picture plane and one is larger than the other, distance is implied between the two. But distance is unknown: I can’t calibrate the distance between the observer and objects without taking into account the location of the observer. In order to take into account the observer’s location in space relative to the objects I must impose an invisible grid over the picture plane locating each point in relation to another point—suddenly the space is fixed through a set of mathematical terms (</a><a href="#bookmark36" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.18</span>). The perspectival space is measured and, therefore, mapped. Projected perspectival grids allow us to place objects in relative relationship to each other on a two-dimensional plane.</p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Perspective and mirror anamorphosis create interesting visual effects by distorting the perspective  view  so  the  viewer  is  required  to  occupy  a  particular  vantage  point  or  use a special device to reconstitute the view. leonardo da Vinci used <i>oblique </i>anamorphosis very soon after leon Battista Alberti introduced the formal rules of <i>perspectiva artificialis </i><a href="#bookmark67" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">in 1425.</a><span class="s5">24  </span>Mirror or <i>catoptric </i><a href="#bookmark37" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">anamorphosis uses a mirror placed on the drawing to transform a distorted image into a legible picture (</a><a href="#bookmark37" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.19</span><a href="#bookmark38" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">).

These projections similar to the orthographic projections of plan, elevation, and section assume all light rays are parallel from an infinite viewing distance (</a><span class="s1">Figure 2.22</span><a href="#bookmark67" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">). World or cosmographic map projections, unlike other projections having direct geometric interpretations, can only be defined in terms of mathematical formulations. And as there are an infinite number of possible projections the mathematics of each unique projection decidedly privileges one aspect of the actual object over another. This means our original point-of-light analogy only works up to the point that the complexity of the relationship between the geographic points doesn’t require a mathematical transformation between the coordinates. Map projections always distort something. Maps can distort up to five specific geographic relationships: areas, angles, gross shapes, distances, and directions.</a>25 <a href="#bookmark67" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">What is distorted depends on choices made by the cartographer, the context, what is intended, and how the projection is used to convey knowledge.

Similar to the grid, the index calibrates the graphic language of the map, but unlike the grid which is geometry, the index is syntax and akin to language. Indexing takes the signs of one system and draws parallels or analogies to other systems. The journey, a familiar trope in literature, works this way and serves as a simple example. The narration of a story chronologically organized along a path or road parallels or indexes the events of a character’s life at one level and at another the significance of those events relative to the author’s thesis. like journey to adulthood, that brings lessons learned and shapes a character’s nature.

Throughout the discussion of maps I tend to focus on nonword symbols, but some maps play with word symbols. Word symbols link to the sounds made in spoken language and are intelligible to us orally and textually. Maps playing with word meanings by showing multiple visual examples for the same word exemplify this idea (<span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 1.3</span>). nonword symbols share some of the same semantic complexity of word symbols, but lack a phonetic form: the bald eagle for the U.S., the font for a specific product (Coca-Cola), and the lion for england. like all signs, symbols are socially and contextually contingent on their time, place, and cultural legibility. If you can’t ‘read’ the symbol-meaning, the references will be lost to you and their use in the map opaque.</p><p style="padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark43">The index in some ways is the most complicated sign in a map. It is defined by a sensory feature (sound or image) correlating with or ‘pointing to something else’ such that to be successful, indices depend on some regularity between the sensory feature and the correlate. But this is often an artificially constructed (not natural) relationship. In sonar maps, sound is used to index topography. Thematic maps highlight the role of the index. They focus on a specific idea, concept, or theme often relying on a combination of signs to communicate. The </a><i>Carte de Tendre </i>(1654–61) (<span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 0.16</span>) is a thematic map using the trope of journey to describe the territory of love by pointing to or indexing geography of rivers, seas, and mountains with seventeenth-century mores. Its contemporary equivalent is guy Debord’s <i>Guide Psychogeographique de Paris</i>: <i>Discours sur les Passions de L’Amour </i>(1957) [<i>Discourse on the Passions of Love</i><a href="#bookmark87" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">] (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.23</span><a href="#bookmark67" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) using graphic arrows and bits of a Parisian tourist map describing a territory of aimless wandering practiced by the Situationist.</a><span class="s5">27 </span><a href="#bookmark45" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Debord’s map is also an example of a cognitive map. But instead of an image of the city reinforcing a sense of place his map suggests a resistance to the underlying ordering structures of the city. The maps by Charles Joseph Minard, a French engineer and military strategist, contributed to the field of information graphics and demonstrate the role of the index in thematic maps. Minard developed a language of symbols to index complex sets of data into statistical graphs (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figures 2.37 </span><a href="#bookmark47" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.38</span>). Minard’s thematic maps convey a particular theme, say wine consumption in connection with a geographic area in France. Thematic maps tend to use geographical or spatial data only as point of reference for the phenomenon being mapped. This map type (form) has a long history with some of the earliest examples extant from the early 1600s. Minard’s thematic maps are a subset of map types called choropleths in which the measurement of the statistical variable being shown in the map is shaded or patterned to enhance the graphic communication of the data. In the maps shown, the different colors and widths of the arrows indicate quantity, type and direction. A complex thematic map of this type is Minard’s map of napoleon’s doomed russian campaign of 1812, the <i>Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l’Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812– 1813 </i><a href="#bookmark49" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figures 2.39 </span><a href="#bookmark50" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a><span style=" color: #00F;">2.40</span><a href="#bookmark67" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">).

In other itinerary maps it is accomplished by scrolling from one side of the map to the other where the map literally unfolds as the time in the map unfolds. These reminders of our physical engagement with the map, scanning and unfolding, link some of the cognitive procedures of mapping or the understanding of an abstract representation of idea of a place with the embodied sensation of movement. It is as though the cartographer said, ‘Move from here to there and imagine you are following along with the army as it crosses the russian plain to Moscow.’ rudolf Arnheim argued that not only could perceptual problems (movement) be solved by perceptual operations but ‘productive thinking solves any kind of problem in the perceptual realm because there exist no other arena in which true thinking can take place.’ he linked perception to an intuitive mode of thinking structuring the relationship between part and whole, in this case graphic lines with arrows or an unfolding scroll.

Viewing maps implying movement tends to underscore this by revealing through our bodily movement the cognitive process required to understand the contents of the map. or as Arnheim suggests, it is ‘only when someone struggles to discover the order of a complicated composition does he experience within himself something of the shaping process in search of the final image.’</a><a href="#bookmark68" class="s3">32</a></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Minard did not publish his analysis of the 1812–13 campaign until 1861, well after the end of napoleon’s empire, when he was safe from political retribution or worse. In this case the difference between the two times, the time in the map and the time of the map, reveals a socio-political context qualifies the meaning of the map. kevin lynch’s cognitive maps from a <i>View from the Road </i>work similarly in that they convey a sense of progression through time from the point of view of the observer. This type of temporal displacement is of a particular type. It is a cognitive map or a mental model/representation of the phenomena we encode from our everyday spatial environment. The cognitive map lynch draws in the Boston highway project unfolds through the perceptual space of the viewer as they move through  the  city  on  the  highway  (<span style=" color: #00F;">Figures  4.62  </span>and  <span style=" color: #00F;">4.63</span>).  This  is  a  linear  progression  of experience through time documenting what is seen in the environment and reduced by the mapmaker to a series of familiar signs. Text-based accounts employ the same disassociated temporal frame but the map’s unique property as a documentation of something assumed to be true or real exposes the dialectic of the unreal or falsely constructed. If the map is a projection of place but at the same time is <i>of </i>a place or <i>from </i>a time, the assumed structural sense of ‘timelessness’ discloses its own impossibility. Time as an idealized condition in the map can only exist as a possible metaphor rather than probable prescription.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Place</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The second function is context, place, or what I call the <i>neutral domain </i>in the map: the blank bits, the area covered with trees, the so-called junk DnA on the double-helix which asserts itself only in contrast to the part of the map to which we are giving attention.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Place is a difficult term. on the one hand it presents itself as a given—in the map is a world, but this world is only part of a number of possible worlds. here I want to make a distinction between the logic of mapping and a methodology. In practice, the knowledge contained by the map can be applied and used. But as a procedure for making changes to a given condition, posing a solution to what appears to be given, the logic of mapping qua mapping casts light on the assumptions we make in the instance of choosing what to focus attention on and what to neutralize. The neutral domain or ‘placeness’ is what comes forward when we peer from the side toward the map. It is analogous to the lacanian ‘real’ that isn’t synonymous with reality, but an undifferentiated condition without qualification. Placeness in the map resists symbolization. It underlines the gap between map and territory cannot be bridged, but only imagined or dreamed at the edges of the map.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark56" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;" name="bookmark55">one of the oldest world maps, the medieval hereford Mappa Mundi (ca.1285), illustrates the point (</a>Figure 2.45<a href="#bookmark68" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">).

The project was for a kindergarten and Pope observed the joyful and exuberant way children play. His analysis yielded a particular flow of movements including running, jumping, turning and skipping. After using a chronophotographic technique borrowed from J.-E. Marey to analyze the flow of the movements, he created a controlled environment replicating the observed motions (top right). These were moderately successful, but variables proved more difficult to control and the motion of the ‘waves’ did not replicate the original observed patterns. Pope worked with the original patterns to create a floor acting as a ‘play surface’ in the final proposal for the kindergarten. One of the challenges was translating an understanding of the initial observation into an architectural language. The final proposal was evocative, but it was a literal interpolation of the initial ‘children flow map.’ This was Pope’s third studio and thus understandable that making the translation to an architecture would prove challenging. Less direct than the floor was the rhythmic patterning of the wall surface.

The space of the street is expanded and contracted by the map. expanded because the views can extend quite far at specific points, contracted because the map focuses the reader’s attention to the extents of the city perceived from this one street. The city becomes a neutral domain suppressed for the sake of one particular route. The neutral domain or context is a category of in-between-ness present literally, metaphorically, and figuratively in the map. It can produce an effect, an idea, or an illusion of completeness creating a sense of place—those ideas-objects-territories are <i>there </i>but not <i>here</i>—they look and act like the world the mapmaker wants us to believe in brought forth by the representation. neutral domains convince us of the incarnation of the particular context of every map. Place or context is always a constructed notion not a given fact in the map.

Working together with the fundamentally pragmatic orientation towards the world exhibited in the technical and instrumental use of tools and artifacts, it is in natural language, according to Cassirer, the representative function of thought is most clearly visible. For it is primarily through the medium of natural language we construct the ‘intuitive world’ of ordinary sense perception on the basis of what Cassirer calls intuitive space and intuitive time. e.

Implicit in this reading is also the way maps are received by map-readers. The geographical imaginary of the map works in the service of ideology in a visual language difficult to unpack. I am not invoking traditional epistemologies of representation, what richard rorty termed the ‘mirror of nature’—maps as representational artifacts are mirrors only as they present a familiar geography of visual signs. But that misses the point of the map: it is a simulation of reality engaging multiple viewpoints, epistemologies and visual systems. The symmetry of this representational strategy is complete: the complexity of reality means one map can’t explain everything possible about any single place, idea or thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 156pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">In discussing maps and power, one of the first questions is: Who made the map? Certainly the cartographer, but also patrons and institutions commissioning maps and the structures supporting, financing, and nurturing them. Maps are socially constructed artifacts that frame and reconceptualize what a cartographer holds apart from the world. The mapmaker’s agency is in determining content and context represented in the map. In design the agent may be the architect, landscape architect, urban designer or other professional and the agency may be personal or shared, but similar mapping procedures apply: selecting what to observe in the map and how to communicate it. Consideration of the agency of the mapmaker is always in play: the socially constructed practices informing how and what the mapper sees in the world conditioned by their historicity, technologies mediate sensual phenomenon and the cognitive and intellectual context in which they</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">organize their perceptions. French theorist henri lefebvre introduced the idea of a spatial triad of social, physical and mental space, including the space of the mapper helping us unpack the idea of representation and power in cartography.<span class="s5">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Maps work in the same way robin evans suggests architectural representations work, where geometry, far from being a stolid and dormant partner in architecture is an active agent in the links between thinking and imagination, imagination and representation, and representation and building. In <i>Translations from Drawing to Architecture, </i>evans shows ‘recognition of the drawing’s power as a medium turns out unexpectedly to be recognition of the drawings’ distinctness from and unlikeness to the thing represented, rather than its likeness...’<span class="s5">2 </span>For ‘drawings’ substitute the specifics of the map (where we consider all architectural drawings as maps) and evans’ dictum holds true. But rather than looking for evans’ gap between the drawing and the object as explanation for opportunities in the material expression of the contours of the object produced from abstract representational schema, we move in this chapter to consider the consequences of the spatial identities and practices inscribed through the grapheme of the map.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Using lefebvre’s theory, maps, plans, models and designs are <i>representations of space</i>. Maps created by architects, cartographers and geographers conceptualizing topographical or  terrestrial  space  as  territory  or  space  are  controlled  through  the  agency  of  dominant ideologues. representations of spaces shape inhabitants and in turn, shape their production of space. <i>Representational space </i>for lefebvre is the space of ideas, imagination and theory. Signs, slogans, and political manifestos are the symbolic manifestations of the space of representation.  The  <i>spatial  practice  </i>of  a  society  is  the  third  space  revealed  through  the daily reality or routines of urban places—it is cohesive, but not necessarily logical. This is  the  space  of  natural  phenomenon  transformed  by  social  practices  over  time.  We  can best understand this space through ‘the study of natural rhythms, and the modification of those rhythms and their inscription in space by means of human actions.’<span class="s5">3  </span>For the designer engaged in understanding how these representations work in the map it is crucial to manage the perceptual and cognitive reception of the space produced through the map. given the map  ‘precedes  the  territory’  as  Baudrillard  argues,  constructing  maps  projects  the  way territory operates on all three levels of lefebvrian representation. This chapter addresses how to think about the way ideologies are communicated by and built into the map. The primary  evidence  are  maps  made  by  architects  and  urban  designers,  but  the  principles apply  as  readily  to  maps  produced  by  cartographers  at  the  behest  of  governments  or patrons. An example of the principle of selecting and structuring contents in the map will serve to illustrate.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #231F20;">Betty ng’s map entitled </span><span class="s4">Disneytopia </span><a href="#bookmark69" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(</a>Figure 3.1<a href="#bookmark70" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) remaps the typical Disneyland tourist map.

Trevino’s remapping focuses on the experiences of the original map and offers a ‘rubik’s cube’ of possibilities depending on the itinerary of the park goer not the sequence presented in the original map, implying a set of movements suggested by the entry point into the theme park. The remap by Cooke (</a>Figure 3.6<span style=" color: #231F20;">) offers a similar take: the original single sheet map is divided and folded similar to a street map, dividing separate themed areas in the park into quadrants refolded and misfolded to provide alternate routes.

Using Foucault, harley argued maps are not neutral: making a map requires selection and reduction on the part of the cartographer—in other words subjective decisions reflecting not an absolute mirror of the world, but one distorted and filtered by social contracts and power structures.<span class="s5">8 </span>rather than a scientific and essentialist representation of reality, for harley maps provide selective views. Denis Wood borrowing from French theorist roland Barthes’ semiotic strategy with language and myth extends the notion of the map as a social construction. he argues maps work on a shared culture reading of the codes or language employed in the map.<span class="s5">9 </span><a href="#bookmark74" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">As an instrument for opening up the visual imagery in the map, Barthean visual semiotics and iconography allow us to cast the representation (denotative) and symbolic (connotative) meaning of the people, places and things (including abstract things) in different codes in the map. Denotation refers to a literal meaning of a sign; for instance in the map ‘house’ is literally represented through the pictogram of a house. Connotations are the associations—emotional, intellectual, and cultural—of the sign: the house signifies home, warmth and security. The semiotic structure shown in </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Diagram 3.2 </span>explains how the map can be both a sign and a signiﬁer—the map is more of a strategy for signiﬁcation than a collection of signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #00F;">Diagram 3.2 </span>builds on Barthes’ illustration of the semiotic of text. If we loosely apply semiotic theory to images we countenance more complex interpretations of visual images and words referring to a relationship between two referents. Maps take signs—words, images, film or moving images—communicating meaning and use them to stand in for something else so the original sign becomes part of a new sign.<span class="s5">10 </span>In this organization,</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.6</p><h2 style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Margaret Cooke, <span class="s2">Disneyland</span>, Washington University in St. Louis, 2012.

The Mercator map made it possible for a ship’s navigator to use <i>rhumb </i>lines, the constant sailing courses crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, to navigate the world’s oceans and seas. The gall–Peters map (1855–1973) is an equal-area projection favoring a more accurate portrayal of landmass. Continents in the gall–Peters projection are shown closer to their actual land area than the Mercator map. Both maps correspond to different features of the globe represented through denotation by the shapes and locations of the continents, but their utility as world maps is the same. The second level of signiﬁcation is found in the utility of the maps as instruments of political power. To read this requires both <i>form </i>(that shape is germany and that shape is France) and c<i>ontent </i>(the concept of a country as a territory represented on the map by lines and color) and visual cues like <i>centeredness </i><a href="#bookmark76" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">indicating importance just as top and bottom indicate relative important. The Mercator map (see </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.12</span>) illustrates how we might read the map: in the Mercator projection the map effectively positions the Western-world countries at the center of the globe, thus the center of power. even though the gall–Peters map is more accurate for landmass and position, the ideology represented through the Mercator projection continues to this day as the normative image of the globe regardless of its original use (for sea travel) while the gall– Peters projection remains relatively obscure. This is not surprising given Western hegemony is undermined somewhat by the gall–Peters’ map more accurate depiction of the southern continents and their position relative to the layout of the map. Territory equates with power, and showing the tremendous difference in size between sub-Saharan Africa and the United States sends an altogether difference message than the current political narrative.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mapping Identity: ‘Japaneseness’</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The following discussion of the architect kenzo Tange’s proposal for the Tokyo Bay Competition (1960)  illustrates  how  the  representation  of  space  and  the  space  of  representation  work together to construct notions of power and identity in the map.

I will continue to do this with my family for the next seven days.<span class="s5">21</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The map is valued as a visual image more than a vehicle for disseminating knowledge. Because of Japan’s economic self-sufficiency and geographic separation their maps are more inner-focused than other traditions and somewhat ‘rhetorical and ornamental in character.’ As k. Unno suggests, ‘There was little impetus to map the world beyond its own shores.<span class="s5">22 </span>It was Japan that mattered most to the Japanese.’<span class="s5">23 </span>The instrumentality of the Japanese map is its rhetoric. Maps communicate about ‘place,’ rather than topographical precision. Map scholars agree that Asian mapping more than occidental cartography shared ‘the aesthetic principles of painting and poetry’ and was used ‘for education, for aesthetic appreciation, to express emotional states, to represent power, to settle disputes, to symbolize submission or subordination, and to promote immortality.’<span class="s5">24</span></p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Tange’s proposal obliquely references one of the earliest surviving maps: the <i>Gotenjiku zu </i>(<i>zu </i>is map or ‘diagram’), the ‘Map of the Five India’s’ (1364). The map reconstructs the pilgrimage journey of the Buddhist monk Xuanzhiang to India (<span class="s7">ad</span>649–45) drawn by the priest Jukai. Its power derives from the metaphorical content of the representation. The map signifies <i>journey</i>—the road and the abstract terrain. It is an object of worship even today with preserved copies in temples throughout the islands. Various written descriptions ostensibly tell the story of Xuanzhiang’s travels as they simultaneously construct a history of the spread of Buddhism and its symbolic cosmography. The metaphorical syntax of the Tange plan is similar and the representational strategies correspond with the notion of a ‘journey’ undertaken as the morphology of the city.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">one additional map common in Japanese cartography and important as a reference in the Tange proposal are paddy-field maps. These maps relate to land ownership projected using the <i>jori </i>system,<span class="s5">25 </span>a grid of east–west, north–south rope-lines stretched over paddy fields. Unlike the graticule imposed on an occidental map, the <i>jori </i>is usually not drawn on the map, and if it is, the grid is not used as a coordinate system but as an aid to estimating distances. Similar to the <i>tatami </i>mat, this is an implicit system that constructs spatial relationships from inside to outside; in the map it organizes the spatial relationships. The <i>jori </i><a href="#bookmark79" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">system is found in the Tange map as the ordering system for the scale and proportion of the megastructure proposed across Tokyo Bay (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.15</span><a href="#bookmark84" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, see also </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.20</span>).

As a utopian project it is more than a functional city plan: it is a projection of cultural values, technological aspirations and social relations instantiated in the representation of space in the map. It is to this we turn next.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 1960 Tokyo Bay Plan</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">There are three parts to the map: the photogrammetric base, the megastructure bar, and artificial ground or platforms arrayed around the bay. The first constructive ordering system is similar to the <i>jori </i><a href="#bookmark80" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and accounts for the proportional relationships present in the bar and the location of its attachments. The second order is the program of the proposed megastructure ‘bar’ zoned as follows: industry located on the platforms; housing, leisure and government functions on the bar with transportation functions distributed throughout the proposed new city. The only significant addition to the existing city is the road system attached to the bar (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.16</span>). Formal additions aren’t integrated into the natural topography of the city and appear almost to ‘float’ above it. Just as in the <i>Gotenjuku zu, </i><a href="#bookmark81" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">abstraction is a constitutive element not displaced by the photographic content implied by the map representation. The representation homogenizes the megastructure and the cityscape and this seamless context diminishes both the size and artificiality of Tange’s modern Babel: the city and proposed megastructure become one and the same. The precepts of the modernist city expounded by the Congrès International d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM) are obvious in the legend or index of the map (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.17</span>)—the zoned program of the bar aligns well with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="422" height="472" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_073.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark80">3.16</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Proposed roadway infrastructure for the redevelopment plan.</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark81">Types of conveyance in the network of transportation systems are color-coded.

The map legend articulates the concept of movement or mobility.

Tange starts with photogrammetry or aerial photography and new objects or buildings are drawn into the base to create his urban proposal (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figures 3.18 </span><a href="#bookmark83" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a><span style=" color: #00F;">3.19</span>).

This representational schema blurs distinctions between the topographic map based on measured survey as a surface with the absence of a positioned viewer and the perspectival construction of the picture plane. This is not to make a specific claim about subjective perception in relation to Tange because Japanese representational traditions are not contingent on a singular view or convergent perspective; the paradox of Tange’s map is its allusion to the perception of a three- dimensional model that exemplifies or symbolizes by serving as a sample of properties it literally and metaphorically possesses. Closer scrutiny of the photogrammetry in the map reveals that what looks like aerial photogrammetry isn’t: only the area surrounding the historic center is actual photogrammetry. Starting at edo Palace, context is represented by aerial imagery—as the bar grows across the Bay to the proposed future, the representation of context becomes increasingly abstract. The majority of the base is a collage created from aerial photos that can’t be viewed with a stereoscope. research revealed the aerial images Tange used were part of a project funded by the government to photograph the islands after the war, symbolically reclaiming its postwar territory. The appropriated topographies follow a strict pattern in relation to the placement of the megastructure bar.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark84" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">The bar (</a><a href="#bookmark84" class="a">Figure </a>3.20<span style=" color: #231F20;">) links or offers passage from one condition to another, but unlike a connective bridge, the bar is </span><span class="s4">directive</span><a href="#bookmark82" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">. It is a megastructure starting at the heart of the city that ‘grows’ over time moving from a legible representation of the city through actual photogrammetric images to the abstract landscape indicated by the photographic collage (see </a><a href="#bookmark82" class="a">Figures 3.18</a> <a href="#bookmark83" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a>3.19<span style=" color: #231F20;">). like the </span><span class="s4">Gotenjuku zu </span><span style=" color: #231F20;">map, the passage of time is exemplified by the implied growth of the bar along which the map-reader is directed to move by the</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="669" height="153" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_077.gif"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark84">3.20</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Detail of the ‘civic axis.’ K.

This contradicts the apparent neutrality of the linear system that similar to the grid, is a familiar trope of the modernist planning movement. Instead the bar and its context in the map direct the viewer to dialectics of time (past/future) and motion (static/fluid) at the heart of the assertion of Japanese-ness in the planning proposal for Tokyo. The technology employed by Tange’s pseudo-aerial images highlight the tension between the map as a scientific tool and the place of the map in Asian/ Japanese cartography as rhetorical and symbolic. The apparent contradiction is part of the power of this representation of the proposed new city of Tokyo.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Typically, aerial imagery separates the viewer from the city and in Western cartographic tradition implies a ‘voyeuristic’ displacement. In Japanese mapping this does not necessarily follow because <i>loss </i>of identity in eastern thought is itself a kind of identity—let me explain. Daisetz  Suzuki, a Japanese  philosopher often quoted  by Tange and the Metabolists, asserts ‘so kuhi no ronri’ or ‘<i>A </i>is non-<i>A</i>, therefore it is called <i>A’ </i>where ‘what seem to be contradictions turn out in the end to be <i>identities</i>.’<span class="s5">31 </span>historically, Western philosophy insists on absolute categories while eastern philosophy allows for paradox as a constituent part of the nature of being. Western philosophies demand categorization of objects based on differences in characteristics such that identities are singular: <i>A </i>can only be <i>A</i>, not <i>B</i>. For Japanese philosophy ideas and objects can be <i>both/and </i><a href="#bookmark85" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">without undermining their ontological integrity. Identity is not affirmed through difference—it is nuanced. Ise Shrine (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.21</span>) helps explain this idea more concretely. The temple is rebuilt every twenty years on a site adjacent to the ‘original’ using wood from trees grown for this express purpose surrounding the temple(s). Upon completion of the ‘new’ temple the ‘old’ temple is removed. The cycle repeats <i>ad inifinitum </i>in turn creating new/old temples at any point in time as a single ‘ideal temple’ always completed or torn down: no contradiction inheres in Japanese philosophy for an artifact to be new/old and same/ different.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The  concern  with  social  identity  or  the  social-self  reflected  in  the  <i>speculum  mundi </i>of  a  society’s  architectural  order  presupposes  as  van  eyck  suggests  there  <i>is  </i>an  order and that order is legible.<span class="s5">32  </span>order occurring at various scales is one of the themes of the Tange map: the internal order of society <i>and </i>the relationship of society to a new order: a global order.

The isolation of the Japanese ‘organization man’ (orgmen—the post-war white-collar office worker) was not the threat as much as the trend for this society of orgmen to pursue a policy of isolation or, put another way, it is not disassociation within society, but the potential for Japanese society’s disassociation from the global plurality. Tange redresses this in his proposed utopia. he cites two thinkers in later writings crucial to his social agenda: the economist William rostow, one of the authors of the Marshall Plan and karl Popper, a philosopher and cultural historian. From rostow Tange borrows the idea all economies develop linearly from small to large characterized as moving from production-based societies to service- societies. Tange appropriates this idea in the map by the superimposition of the circulation strategy onto the megainfrastructure of the bar. The growth proposed for the bar is the linear progression model suggested by rostow. In <i>Open Society and Its Enemies </i>Popper, and through him, Tange, take issue with the idea of historicism.<span class="s5">33 </span>Popper argues ‘historicism’ is a mode of discovering laws of history enabling us to prophesy the course of historical events. This is essentially a critique of Marxism on the basis of its claim to a kind of ‘social Darwinism’<span class="s5">34 </span>For Popper the falsifiability of this proposition is easily demonstrated: give one example of a social past which successfully predicted a social future, including in this case, Marxism—not easily done. Society is constantly transforming and regenerating in response to its present. Because utopian predictions argue for a delayed social condition leading to an arrested society. Popper claims they are antithetical to the nature of discovery and change. Instead the abstract future emerges from a concrete past and is the basis for a present in motion, transformation, and regeneration, in short, <i>organic</i>. This idea shapes Tange’s utopian project. Identity or social constructions should not be static. This would</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">limit what Suzuki called ‘A’ to only ‘non-A,’ where the paradox is more productive. Tange’s map structures this relationship as a social possibility based on a spatial present and draws from the history of rhetorical mapping within the oriental tradition. The network suggested by Tange is as much cognitive construct based in part on the conditions of the present city as an exemplification of the ‘mobility’ possible across the geography of the map. The ‘old city’ (edo Palace) is the most identifiable concrete representation on the map, but like the <i>Gotenjuku zu</i>, Tange’s map reads as a journey from a known ‘place’ to an abstract future— across the bar to the abstracted landscape collage and across time to a possible future city and new Japanese identity in a post-war world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">New Geographies, New Territories</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The difference between territory and geography is one of degree not kind. Territory emphasizes the agency of the dominant power or ideology through the representation of place. geographies inscribe and privilege cultural, scientific, and technological dimensions in the map. This can be confusing because geographic maps actually describe topography, not really geography in the sense of the study of places and the relationship between people and their environments. geographic maps describe land features, cities, and so on in a planimetric configuration based on euclidean geometric ordering.<span class="s5">35 </span>Chorographs illustrate the idea of geographies opposed to the literal geographic map. They are pictorial maps used to describe places often incorporating perspectival views that help the viewer connect to the place.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, territories are geographic areas belonging to or controlled by external agents: monarchies, democracies, and multinational corporations. In the instance of a territory as geography, the map draws boundaries, identifies place names, locates center to edge and imposes the ideological order of the dominant agent onto topographies creating geographies of culture, science and power. Designers as agents similarly use maps to propose new conditions, create new contexts, present new hegemonies—in short, offer a way to see the world requiring the viewer to reorder their mental map and reposition themselves in the new spatial practice—the following discussion of camouflage offers a new perceptual geography as case in point. Paul Virilio makes an argument for the impossibility of doing this in the contemporary terrestrial map.<span class="s5">36 </span>It requires us to develop new map stratagems. he makes the point that virtual transmission of information within globalism today is <i>extra</i>- terrestrial based on the contraction of time and space produced by systems of virtual communications. Power and authority are literally transmitted in the blink of an eye over vast spatial territories—older terrestrial maps depended on a relation between distance and time to convey power in the form of territory. The image of the world can be infinitely reproduced and reduced: encapsulated in visually arresting images.

The reader has to know the map of Paris well to ascertain the subtle compressions in herman’s map: he reduced the distance by re-weaving (I can’t think of a different term for it) the street map. Paris remapped is nonsensical and impossible yet the representation of space is convincing. This is closer to the idea of the spatial practice of the users for whom whole parts of the city will appear and disappear depending on how routinized they are. This happens to everyone: you sometimes can’t remember  driving  or  walking  your  neighborhood  yet  you  go  through  it  every  day.  guy Debord’s  <i>Psychogeographic  Map  of  Paris  </i><a href="#bookmark87" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">(</a><a href="#bookmark87" class="a">Figure  </a><span style=" color: #00F;">3.23</span>)  is  similar.  Playing  with  parts  of louis Bretez and Michel-Étienne Turgot’s famous tourist map of Paris (1739), references to the <i>Carte du Tendre </i><a href="#bookmark88" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and the Paris subway map, Debord constructs a representation of a possible cognitive map of Paris—this is the Paris experienced while wandering aimlessly between  sets  of  strange  attractors,  monuments,  cafes,  and  unusual  places  in  the  city. What looks at first like a random displacement of the fragments of the city (</a><a href="#bookmark88" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">3.24</span>) when graphically overlaid on the city map is in fact quite ordered. oddly, the fragments correspond  to  major  subway  stops.  like  an  inverse  of  herman  Mao’s  map,  the  Debord map indicates what is removed, but doesn’t actually compress the space in the map. The red arrows linking different fragments of experience in the city compress and reconnect the cognitive space of the city for the map viewer. Mao’s map compresses the geography, but normalizes the representation rendering the map disquieting on close inspection while suggesting the city even when its territory is subverted. Mao’s <i>Map of Paris </i>is a product of the contemporary condition even more so than Debord’s mid-century artifact given it consciously suppresses its own deception: the synthesis of the geographical space and the cognitive one are completed in the map. Moving farther afield we examine two map types at once more difficult to understand but easier to experience as instantiations of territory: camouflage and panorama.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="669" height="183" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_079.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.22</p><h2 style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Herman Mao, <span class="s2">Paris Map</span>, Washington University in St. Louis, 1999.</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="387" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_080.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 384pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark87">3.23</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 384pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">Guy Debord with Asger Jorn, </a><span class="s2">Psychogeographic Map of Paris. </span>The map uses fragments of Louis Bretez and Michel-Étienne Turgot’s <span class="s2">Plan de Paris</span>(1734–39), a tourist map of Paris.

In the ‘space of representation’ mapping frames how power relations are negotiated through spatial practices. In cartographic practice mapping is fundamentally lending order to spatial phenomena in the world. Camouflage is a specialized kind of mapping masking its intent while announcing its presence. Camouflage considered as a map suggests the relationship between place and the perception of space can be managed though a mapping procedure. Under this rubric, camouflage is full-scale mapping: it maps the un-real onto the real. This special form of mapping vacillates between the two poles of space and place signification. Describing camouflage as mapping opens an intersection between geometrical space and sensible place and the axes of representation around which they operate and, therefore, looking at camouflage presents a unique vantage from which to unpack how territories are represented through the map. one example of this kind of full-scale mapping of perception is found in gestalt theory. In gestalt the relationship between figure/ground describes how our spatial imagination receives images. The face/ vase image is a good example—the balance between the figure/ground relation creates a visual paradox—the image is both face and vase at the same time. For gestalt, blurring the difference between object and environment is termed <i>Ganzfeld </i>and precipitates a disordering of spatial perception of the subject. The family of resemblances is unavoidable, camouflage as map, and mapping as ordering of perception share the same set of conditions—namely how we make distinctions between sensible phenomena and how we rearrange ourselves in response to the new grounds they afford. For the modernist avant-garde the answer was observed in the literal relation between the techniques of camouflage, cubism, and the new space-time in science. This is not our focus, but it is a reminder of the multiplicities of meaning attached to transparency and its inverse, camouflage. Understanding camouflage as a map requires a brief look at the history of its use.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Formal camouflage emerges in the early twentieth century as a kit of techniques catalogued and instrumentalized for the science of deception in war. C. h. r. Chesney, the British officer largely responsible for instigating the Anglo-American camouflage troops, gave the first working description: camouflage is the ‘art of concealing the fact you are concealing.’<span class="s5">38  </span>We may ask why the difference between ‘making invisible’ and ‘concealing the fact of concealing’ warrants our attention: it is by construing the meaning of camouflage as degrees of transparency we also understand it as a matter of other degrees: between the real and imaginary, perception and  cognition,  perception  and  representation.<span class="s5">39    </span>given  the  intent  of  camouflage  is  to conceal the act of concealing it reveals a slippage between physical geographies and their representation more normative map-making procedures mask. robin evans refers to this as the ‘projective cast’ resulting from the translation between representations, space, and the imagination. In the case of camouflage the representation is a map occurring at the scale of the geographical space onto which the imaginary space collapses.<span class="s5">40  </span>Chesney’s characterization directs us to a more nuanced understanding of camouflage as the phenomenal difference between what we think reality is and how it is presented to us. I use two ideas to reconsider the procedures of camouflage as a map: 1) mapping as cognition and 2) mapping perception. literal camouflage is the techniques developed for warfare, and <i>phenomenal </i>camouflage is</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maps as Power, Identity and Utopia</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">the potentially productive disordering of spatial perception through mapping. The former is addressed briefly; the latter requires additional discussion of the idea of mimicry from nature, and some examples of the camouflage of perception as a reconfiguration of intra-subjective experience and the ordering imposed on spatial realities. For the reader looking for a direct application, the last map in <span style=" color: #00F;">Chapter 4 </span>uses ‘camouflage as map’ in a design project.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Techniques of the Camoufleur</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Derived from the analysis of animal mimicry, camouflage is not mere replication, but a reordering of spatial perception through the manipulation of patterns and pattern recognition, optics, and light. Techniques of camouflage were observed first in insect and animal coloration believed used for defense and offence in predation. British zoologists Solomon J. Solomon and John kerr, and Abbott Thayer the American artist, catalogued the characteristics of camouflage used by animals in the wild: i) modeling and shadow, ii) outline, which relates to pattern, iii) tone or variations in light, shade and texture, particularly important when manipulated for artificial camouflage, and iv) color. French camoufleurs influenced by Cubist work made a connection between the effectiveness of counter-shading breaking up form that tends to flatten out the shape of an object and its utility in the battlefield.<span class="s5">41</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark89" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Military  camouflage  used  to  conceal  objects  from  ground  troops  operates  within  the picture-plane, and like pictorial representation is dependent on the position of the viewer to  a  particular  frame  of  reference.  When  camouflage  operates  in  real  time  at  the  same scale relative to the observer, time orders the experience through movement and memory. effective camouflage stimulates memory by mimicking the familiar. An example of whole building camouflage, the lockheed Burbank Aircraft Plant becomes a suburban neighborhood (</a><a href="#bookmark89" class="a">Figures 3.25</a> <a href="#bookmark90" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">to </a>3.27<a href="#bookmark91" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">) complete with houses, streets, cul-de-sacs and fences. The image of the lockheed facility under net camouflage challenges the viewer to distinguish between the real and artificial much as the map of the proposed Faux Paris outlined alternate boundaries for city of Paris fabricated during World War II to deceive aircraft bombardiers (</a><a href="#bookmark91" class="a">Figure </a>3.28<span style=" color: #231F20;">).</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark91" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Successful aerial camouflage depends on working in oblique and vertical representation at the same time. Concealment from the air takes into account both views and is fundamentally a three-dimensional problem (</a>Figure 3.29<span style=" color: #231F20;">). note the similarity between the demands of camouflage and a condition always present in views of cities, namely the tension between the plan view and the prospect or oblique view. reality constituted by both views is never in doubt, but representational views in normative maps only hint at the cancellation in effect: the choice of one view displaces the other. Camouflage as a kind of literal mapping takes into account the position of the observer in both axes. This rather strange mapping demands an embodied viewer—you are in the space of the map—without relinquishing awareness of the geometric or cognitive space of the map, the view from above also being manipulated. This is more than art-in-the-world: this is the world as art, a position not unlike Schopenhauer’s assertion that the relation between transcendental knowledge of the world as representation is qualified by the subject’s willingness to lose oneself in the process of absorbing aesthetic experience.</span><span class="s5">42</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Physicist and philosopher of science ernst Mach, searching for physiological associations in ideas and interested in developing a science of perception, defined sensible</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="369" height="285" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_082.gif"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark89">3.25</a></p><h2 style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Lockheed Aircraft Plant in Burbank, CA, prior to camouflage.

Camouflage as spatial mimicry relies on the two extremes of space proposed by Mach. Camouflage reveals the role of the observer not as a unified subject, but as a disordered ‘subject of knowing’ where spatial creation never detaches itself from perception. rather it always implies a relationship between the observer and the observed. This marks the tension between sensible and pictorial space. In the former the sense of self is locatable in space; in the latter, euclidean geometrical space blurs the distinction between the self and the environment. It is worth remembering: for mimicry in nature as for human use, resemblance exists solely in the eye of the beholder. To a leaf-like insect the ‘leaf-like thing’ is just another self, not a self in disguise. like artificial camouflage this undermines the distinction between organism and environment and the connection between the mind and a particular point in space.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">As we saw in aerial camouflage, the observer vacillates between these two spaces: the horizontal-oblique view of approach and the vertical or aerial view from above a target. This multiplied space of representation blurs the distinction between figure and ground, manipulating perception and cognition in a kind of reciprocal mapping that displaces the subjects’ ‘ontological sense of gravity.’ It categorically undermines the axis of difference between perception and representation. The art historian rosalind krauss makes a similar claim for the ‘optical unconscious’ where human vision is less a master of all it surveys and more a product of a paradoxical relationship between perception and vision.<span class="s5">44 </span>For kraus, perception and vision—or background and visual structure—press on our view of abstract art so the background reappears in the abstract grid-structure of the work while the figure is suppressed to the unconscious. Visual structure as non-figure is synonymous with the unconscious. The frame of an image doesn’t embed an actual figure into the image, but constitutes a map of logical relationships. Much like camouflage, imaginary modern perception is characterized by transparency, simultaneity, and immediacy, as well as its rendering frame.<span class="s5">45 </span>remember for a moment the gestalt optical illusion of putting two vases next to each other and producing a third immaterial vase formed between the two. Camouflage, like the vase illusion, fluctuates between three poles: the representation of space, representational space, and the space of practice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">New Geographies from Before: the Victorians and Panorama</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The following case examines how the cartographic imagination enables us to project new geographies through the panorama. Panoramas are pictorial constructions of space ordered by perspective projection placing the subject in a measured relationship to the viewer. Spatial relationships within the representation are relative to a vanishing point specific to the point of view of the observer. The territory framed by the view is limited by the horizon in depth and the limits of distortion in width. This is controlled by how far the viewer is from the object being viewed. Panoramas are a specific type of chorograph and an excellent way to understand how the geographic imagination is engaged through the map. The next section outlines the general characteristics of the panorama within the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">165</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">context of chorographic maps and then looks at a specific case: one of the first panoramic cityscapes, the <i>View of London from the Albion Mills </i><a href="#bookmark92" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">by robert Barker (1739–1806), and its instrumentality as a map including its cultural signification as a new form of ‘looking’ in the industrial city (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.30</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Initially the city was the primary subject of panoramas, but very quickly two other view-types developed: narrative taken from recent or ancient wars or battles of military conquest and power, and travelogues showing a scene from a distant land. Although all three types could arguably be a kind of map, I concentrate on cityscapes because of the similarity to the chorograph or pictorial map. The panorama looks too much like a picture to be taken otherwise by the modern sensibility. The deception is the panorama’s apparent transparency and the ease with which we confuse its ‘pictorialism’ with reality in the case of the photograph, or conversely with the painted panorama, its naturalness as a painting.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">In the manner of Mikhail Bakhtin who uses the form of the novel to interrogate canonical genres within literature, what he terms ‘novelizing,’ I use the panorama to ‘pictorialize’ the map—open a discussion of mapping through the device of the panorama. Placing emphasis on authenticity and the completeness of the view is reminiscent of map stratagems. The panorama’s scientific authority is based on this hyperreality projected through perspective. The relative relationships of the scene are reconfigured on a two-dimensional vertical surface or picture plane so when viewed from a pre-determined distance (usually about 15–20 feet) the distortions are minimized and the simulacrum of a totalizing view is created. In the case of the panorama, these views are elided so the singular vanishing point blurs and there are <i>multiple vanishing points </i>with infinite possible positions for the subject to look at the scene. The success of this technique can be measured, in part, by criticism levied against the panorama that it was too real and would lead to the individual’s inability to distinguish reality from illusion.<span class="s5">46 </span>Unlike the chorograph, the size of the panorama intensified the experience of viewing the map—literally <i>everything </i>was a picture. The panorama and later aerial views come closer than any other map forms to Borges ‘map of the empire, whose size was that of the empire and which coincided point for point with it.’<span class="s5">47</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark93" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">robert Barker exhibited some of the earliest panoramas in the late eighteenth century. Very quickly Barker realized the need for a specially constructed building (</a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.32</span>) to accommodate the specific needs of displaying a panorama: namely, a curved wall and the controlled lighting. The first panorama rotunda christened the Panorama opened 25 May 1793 with the ‘View of the grand Fleet at Spithead in the Year 1791.’ The two-level building housed two viewing circles. The larger lower circle accommodated a 10,000 square foot image and the smaller, upper circle one of 2,700 square feet.

Soon after opening the exhibit, Barker realized the need for a specially constructed building to accommodate the needs of displaying a panorama; namely, a curved wall and the controlled lighting. He commissioned the design of a building from Robert Mitchell, an Edinburgh architect; and the first panorama rotunda, christened the <span class="s2">Panorama</span>, opened 25 May 1793 with the ‘View of the Grand Fleet at Spithead in the Year 1791.’ The two- level building (see <span style=" color: #00F;">Fig. 4.4</span>) housed two viewing circles. The larger Lower Circle could accommodate a 10,000 square foot image and the smaller, Upper Circle one of 2,700 square feet. Besides the rotunda form, important features of the building were: 1) the lighting of the canvases which was done from overhead so that light would fall onto the view as in reality, and 2) the sequence of movements whereby the viewer was removed from the exterior ‘real’ environment to the ‘recreated real’ environment of the canvas.</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The building allowed for maximum control of the visual scene.

First, it is a product of an advance in scientific invention in the technique of reproducing three-dimensional spatial relationships onto a two-dimensional surface. The geometry of projection engaged by the panorama is specific and measured no more or less than the scalar reduction of geographic space in an ichnographic map. As a socio-political document the panorama reframes the subjectivity of the individual in rapidly changing social conditions and repositions the industrial subject within the growing urban complex. It rationalized the position of the industrialist within new power structures of emerging capitalist society at the same time it commodified the city by replicating its reality in the ‘view at a glance.’</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The Victorian era is visually delineated by the importance given the technological innovations of science and the new engineer-technocrats.

But with a particularly english twist: the only building to fall in the center of the london panorama panel most accurately aligned with the vanishing point in perspective, and therefore least distorted is St. Paul’s Cathedral. It looms like a beacon in the skyline in a kind of reversal of the ‘central eye’ or ‘position of the watcher’ in Bentham’s Panopticon (</a><a href="#bookmark94" class="a">Figure  </a><span style=" color: #00F;">3.34</span>).<span class="s5">49   </span>here  the  eye  of  god  tempers  the  english  drive  to  technocracy  with  a reminder of the balancing power of the church in society. In effect there are two centers in the ‘map’: one, the literal center of the rotunda from which the view is optimized; and two, the visual center focused on the Cathedral. It is the tension between these two that signifies meaning  in  the  map.  As  Foucault  notes,  ‘Such  asymmetry  of  seeing-without-being-seen is, in fact, the very essence of power because ultimately, the power to dominate rests on the differential possession of knowledge.’<span class="s5">50  </span>Accordingly the Panopticon was designed to ensure a ‘surveillance that would be both global and individualizing.’<span class="s5">51  </span>In the case of the english panoramic map, the pictorial describes the contours of surveillance both personal and global.

Bentham argued the perfect prison would be structured so that cells would open to a central tower. Individuals in the cells do not interact with each other and are constantly confronted by the panoptic tower (pan=all; optic=seeing). They cannot see when there is a person in the tower; they must believe they could be watched at any moment: ‘the inmate must</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">never know whether he is being looked at at any one moment; but he must be sure he may always be so.’<span class="s19">53 </span>Bentham saw prison reform as a model for how society should function.</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To maintain order in a democratic and capitalist society the populace needs to believe any person could be surveyed at any time to ensure the people internalize the panoptic tower and police themselves: ‘He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.’<span class="s19">54</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">panorama makes it possible for the individual to become grand—to take in the expanse of a world from a comfortable vantage point while reinforcing the role ofthe individual in perpetuating the value codes of english society.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark95" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">In a contemporary take on the panorama, erin Dorr used a search engine to find images of iconographic buildings uploaded to the Internet (</a>Figures 3.35<a href="#bookmark96" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">, </a>3.36 <a href="#bookmark97" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a>3.37<span style=" color: #231F20;">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The composite map of these city skylines includes between 200 to 500 images overlaid so the origin point is at the icon.

Dorr’s maps testify to the power of these forms not  because  they  are  subjects  of  many  of  the  photographs,  but  because  they  seem  to hold  their  formal  definition  from  any  viewpoint  within  the  city.  These  archetypal  figures are  urban  artifacts  acting  as  ‘primary  elements’  contributing  to  the  morphological  and cultural evolution of the city when built and beyond. Their influence continues to shape the collective images of the city and remains fixed even as other objects around them change. A similar primary element is seen in the map (</a><a href="#bookmark98" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">3.38</span>) made by Carolina rivera and Jessica Dickinson in genova. The map shows multiple photographs of the city skyline to establish the lighthouse or the lanterna as a primary element. Interestingly the map also shows an overlay of topographic maps of the city from the 1400s to the present day. The escarpment on which it stands was at one time a peninsula prior to the infill and reshaping of the harbor. Since then the hill around it is significantly reshaped and only the original small rise for the lighthouse remains. The particular promontory of the lighthouse remains fixed even as the boundaries of the harbor shifted dramatically. Perhaps this underscores the  necessity  of  the  function  of  the  lighthouse,  but  it  may  also  point  to  the  collective associations of the city with its role as a port city and the original sacred value given to the</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">land on which the lighthouse is constructed and its locus in the city and harbor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="661" height="405" alt="image" src="Data%20Visualization%20For%20Design%20Think-02_files/Image_095.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.38</p><h2 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carolina Rivera and Jessica Dickinson, <span class="s2">Permanency and Ephemerality of Porto Antico</span>, Florida International University, 2014.</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Future Place(s)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Finally returning to a theme introduced at the beginning of this chapter: mapping utopia. Utopian maps are distinguished from the previous ideological maps of territory and geography simply because the author intends the map as a representation of an imaginary place. This is a bit like saying ‘now you see a duck’ even though everything I show you is also a duck, but maps of utopia have to do this for us to know they are removed from the present. historically this removal in time was a distant future—utopia is from the greek, <i>ou</i>-topia, literally meaning ‘nowhere,’ emphasizing it as a fiction.<span class="s5">56 </span>generally utopias depend on some future technology or a radical political construct enabling a new way of life—More’s utopia supported no private property, a welfare state with free hospitals, euthanasia and priests being allowed to marry. Following on, sociologist karl Mannheim stated the difference between ideology and utopia is in how they affect the world: ‘Ideas which later turned out to have been only distorted representations of a past or potential social order were ideological, while those which were adequately realized in the succeeding social order were relative utopias.’<span class="s5">57 </span>Mannheim emphasizes the impossibility of utopias is the difficulty of changing an existing order from within our own historical context: ‘The representatives of a given order will label as utopian all conceptions of existence which <i>from their point of view </i>can in principle never be realized.’<span class="s5">58 </span>revisions of Mannheim take into consideration late-twentieth-century theories embracing the complexity of determining the social self in relation to the collective, but his general distinction between utopias and ideologies is useful for the discussion here. The former is explicit while the latter is implicit. Maps of utopia like Mannheim’s dictum are represented as fictions that are difficult to reach, but fictions we should strive to attain as relative utopias. however if or when we do attain them, they become our condition and we are hard pressed to see them from <i>our point of view </i>as utopian.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">I unpack Colin rowe’s entry for the 1979 ‘roma Interrotta’ exhibition as case in point. There are many maps of utopia, but using a well-known example proposed by a designer, in this case an architectural historian and a team of designers, enables us to compare a map in the same genre of maps from the mid-twentieth century as the previous Tange example. These maps are part of a shared context of late modernism in architecture and urban design. The visual evidence from designers in this period includes photographs, drawings, and text published in trade magazines, journals and books. The Tange and rowe maps were widely published as part of exhibition or competition catalogues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Roma Interrotta’ revisited</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #231F20;">‘roma Interrotta’ was an invited exhibition held in 1978 in rome by the Incontri Internazionali d’Arte dedicated to urban studies.

For rowe the map represented the ﬁeld of the city as <i>polis </i>and the political sphere it implies expressed as a dynamic relation between built/unbuilt, public/private.<span class="s5">61 </span>gestalt is a theory of visual perception describing how people organize visual elements into groups or unified wholes. The theory emphasizes the relationship between the whole image and its parts. The figure ground refers to how the eye differentiates an object from its surrounding area. objects, forms, and shapes are perceived as figures and the surrounding area is the background or ground. In gestalt, balancing figure and ground makes the image clearer in mind for the observer. A literal interpretation of this <i>Gestalt</i>-form would be dangerously diagrammatic for the architectural drawing, but through the syntax of mapping it is built into the cartographic representation; that is to say, rowe’s position is most clearly understood <i>through the map</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Starting with the characteristics of the original map rowe used for inspiration, the nolli map epitomizes the culmination of renaissance visualization, namely the <i>ichnographic </i>or orthogonal plan.<span class="s5">62 </span>Ichnographic plans represent a view of the topography of a place from above and allow us to measure a scaled distance from one point to another. We still use this today, most commonly for street maps, general area maps, and so forth. The development of this map-type impacted the way cities were represented and how urban spaces might be described. The tradition of drawing the city from a single viewpoint with lines of projection at an oblique angle to the earth’s surface in chorographic maps permitted the <i>illusion </i>of the ‘totalizing’ view, but distorted spatial relationships: objects were drawn with respect to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">a single elevated viewpoint and the distances between them were impossible to measure on the map.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The development of the exact sciences to a large degree depended upon this evolution of an abstract language of representation.<span class="s5">63 </span>leonardo’s plan of Imola (1502) is the first example of a city view based on a surveyed or measured plan. Samuel edgerton suggests a causal relationship between this and leonardo’s <i>Man in a Circle and Square</i>.<span class="s5">64  </span>The connection to cartography especially the employment of the Ptolemaic grid demonstrates the power regularization and visual ordering had on the renaissance mind. In the ichnographic plan the city is portrayed from an infinite number of viewpoints all perpendicular to the topographical features and drawn on a horizontal surface. rowe claimed the ichnographic plan was a new conceptual attitude toward the city ‘in which quantitative topographical relationships were given visual priority over both symbolic values and the actual appearance of the city.’<span class="s5">65</span></p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The nolli map describes not a rome of antiquity. The <i>Grande Pianta </i><a href="#bookmark100" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">is a catalogue of the contemporary rome in 1748. nolli makes graphic distinctions between the ancient and modern, archeology and architecture (see </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Figure 3.40</span>). From historical texts we know he surveyed the city carefully, noting where ancient and contemporary city weave together. Themes of the map include 1) a distinction between the public/private city and 2) history and government. The <i>rioni </i>or districts are demarcated—the map even goes so far as to indicate the city sewage system by denoting the locations of drains.<span class="s5">66 </span>Curiously the rowe plan is bleached of these jurisdictional boundaries. In comparison rowe isolates architecture from history by employing a more simplified graphical representation with stark contrast between buildings rendered in black and the ground in white. This gestalt-like simplification of the graphic language of the map whitewashes the original nolli map’s distinctions between ancient and contemporary, civic neighborhood identities, and municipal infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">The rowe proposition is not a revolutionary plan as it doesn’t posit a new city type; instead its radicality suggests the city, like cubist space, is ‘brought forward and identified with the immediate, physical surface of the canvas.’<span class="s5">67 </span>rowe’s gestalt plan depends upon the ‘figural whole-qualities of the visual field,’ but does not necessarily distinguish homogenous from heterogeneous space because the <i>Gestalt </i>reading insists there are contexts ‘in which what is happening to the whole cannot be deduced from the characteristics of the separate pieces, but conversely; what happens to a part of the whole is, in clearcut cases, determined by the laws of the inner structure of its whole.’<span class="s5">68 </span>Whereas the city is fragmented (we cannot ‘see’ it all at once), the act of measuring demands we construct a mentally abstracted ‘whole’ fluctuating between the part and totality. rowe insists the gestalt view represents the structure of an ideological superstructure while the real city presented in the original nolli map is available only as an illusion that vanishes when reached. In rowe’s terminology the <i>habitat </i>of the city can’t be understood through the separateness of the parts, but must be a whole structure.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark103" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">Analysis of the map demonstrates this and one other feature: rowe’s plan (</a>Figure 3.43<span style=" color: #231F20;">) is a collage of identifiable architectural ‘bits’ regularized through localized geometries—even nature is abstracted and ordered. Most telling perhaps is the inclusion of a section of fictive Aurelian wall at the lower left of the re-drawn map. remember the original plate represents an interior part of the city quite removed from the fortification wall.

Through the use of collage, the world of reality the map usually designates is suspended. rowe assembles a set of identifiable architectural monuments and disavows any actual urban planning. The tension is the representation of ‘plan’ in the abstract countered by the geometric relationship of the parts.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">Although his critical urbanism is not a modernist prescriptive, rowe won’t abandon modernist tenets entirely. he implies the functional ‘zone’ in his rome map through the <i>district</i>, a spatial and political construct existing between the house (private) and the city</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">(public). For rowe the district is where citizen-subjects objectify the ‘law’ as a spatial reality. Curiously the official district demarcation shown on the nolli plan is suppressed in the rowe map. Interpreting this suggests society must not be defined through the law, but the law must be defined by society: the individual through the collective and the public space of the street and square structure social identity and construct the polis. For rowe this ‘plausible abstraction’ must have an order. For corroboration of this we need not look far. rowe and hejduk wrote an article in 1972 articulating the position of the ‘reasonable man’ in relation to the law in the politically charged space of the public domain:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 172pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;">here is the law that assumes public significance [the centralized courthouse and square of lockhart, Texas]; and it is around the secular image of the law, like architectural illustrations of a political principle, that these towns revolve. In each case the courthouse is both visual focus and social guarantee; and in each square the <i>reality of government made  formally  explicit  </i>[sic]  provides  the  continuing  assurance  of  order.

The ideology of ‘roma Interrotta’ redraws a plausible utopian liberty through a visual discourse fluctuating around this paradox. It is in the tension between memory and prophecy, utopia and tradition, represented by the friction of the gestalt image of the map, rowe argues for <i>timelessness </i>or what richard Somol calls rowe’s ‘eternal present.’<span class="s5">71 </span>The terrain of the ideal city can’t be mapped either as a synchronic present or a conditional alternation between past and future. In the map rowe must resort to a repetition of the vernacular and the historic fabric because this attests to the impossibility of an architecturally constructed ‘illustration of a political principle’ operating in the present.<span class="s5">72 </span>While rowe argues that as an imperfect image of the good society ‘utopia will persist,’ he counters it ‘should persist as a possible social metaphor rather than probable social prescription.’<span class="s5">73 </span>The collage operates as metaphor or simile of the social identity possible to construct only from the conditions of the city as a whole. For us to understand our place in the order of the city (given it is spatially divided) it must only be <i>conceptualized </i>in its totality something only possible through the map.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lakes of Wada</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #231F20;">Betty ng, who also authored the map beginning this chapter, drew the </span><span class="s4">Time Warp </span><span style=" color: #231F20;">map shown in </span>Figure 3.46<a href="#bookmark104" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">. ng’s map describes the loss of time in-flight (</a>Figures 3.44 <a href="#bookmark105" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8.5pt;">and </a>3.45<span style=" color: #231F20;">) when traveling from the U.S. to hong kong during the 21-hour time change. her map challenges the notion time is absolute, even in our localized condition.
